And you could tell Marty already knew what was comingby the way he banished himself from the backyard and into the bushes. The first clue was after going through all the footage, and I mean I bear partial responsibilityfor not noticing this myself, but Marty was constantly flexing. It's almost like he had all these new-found muscles and couldn't help it. Was it possiblethat he was secretly eatingnon-regulation walnuts to makehis muscles bigger and stronger?   Well, if he was gonna do thathe'd have to hide them somewhere. And for our second cluewe know that ever since he was younghis favorite spot for hiding stuff was under the rug.  So, while he was busy competing and winning the high jumpa raid was secretly being conductedat Walnut Estates by the authorities. And sure enough, a trap door was discovered. And after peeking inside, they found thesea couple of bags of Russian walnuts.  And I probably don't need to tell you why, but in the Backyard GamesRussian walnuts are strictly prohibited. And so, suddenly it made total sense why he wasthe only one strong enough to conquer the high jump.  And you can imagine when the news leakedto the neighborhood, just how utterly shocked everyone was. - Wow. This is disappointing on a molecular level. And I say that not just as a sportscaster, but as an American.  Quite frankly, it's a disgrace to the integrity of the Backyard Games. - [Mark] But on the bright side, it meant an adjustment had to be made. - This means their high jump gold medal goesto Hubcap Hillsand makes Hubcap Hills the champions of the backyard summer games. - [Mark] And with the news of the reversal, you can see Phat Gus wasted no time making itdown to the trophy. And Augustine was so happy, she just couldn't contain herself. - Well, okay, a lot of saliva on my mustache.  (tone beeps)- So the only question that remained was justhow Marty would've even got ahold of those. It's just, you can only get Russian walnuts at nightfrom the underground sewer network. Squirrels aren't even nocturnal. I mean, he'd have to go through, wait a second,  zoom in right there. Of course, Fat Tail was masterminding the whole thingall along to cheat the system. Eventually, Phat Gus and Augustine tooksome endorsement deals, and they used the money that poured in to relocate their house to the Japanese maple down the streetwith of course the addition of a conspicuous law ornamentas a playful flex to their neighbors below. And speaking of their neighbors, they all eventually found itin their hearts to forgive Marty,  'cause that's just what good friends do, which is all to say in the endthey all lived in harmony happily ever after. Well, except for Fat Tail. He did some hard time in the slammer, 'cause he's a jerk. (death metal music) ♪ Fat Tail. ♪- Fun fact, squirrels only rememberwhere they bury about 25% of their nuts. That means, if you see a big old oak tree, there's a decent chance it's there because of a squirrel.  Now, as a human, I look at this acorn and to be honest, it's not even that big. So, it's crazy to imaginethat this with a little help from Phat Gus could turninto this. This makes squirrels nature's greatest investors, because they leave three out of every four acorns in the ground. And with enough time those acorns can turninto mighty oak trees that can provideway more acorns for generations of squirrel babies to come.

(beat drops)\n","- This is me entering an arcadewearing just your normal everyday backpack. Only, technically it's not your normal everyday backpackbecause when I set it hereand then nonchalantly load a few ballsinto the water bottle, then it plays the game like a good robot should and I win all the tickets. And that's pretty cool, but what if I told you I made similar backpacksnot just for Skee-Ball, but for this game and this one, basically coming up with contraptionsto absolutely dominate five of the most common arcade games,  including some hacks that cost less than a dollarand actually work to set world record ticket payouts. But we also secretly recorded datafrom a bunch of different arcades. So I'll teach you the strategies to beat the games that give out the most tickets, along with showing you the five games we discoveredare actual scams. Don't ever step foot in another arcade againuntil you've watched this video in its entirety. Let's get started.  (upbeat music)Now admittedly, the genesis for this videocame when I was using my over-engineered bowling ballthat I could control just by leaning.  Because I thought, what if I took that same conceptand applied it to mini golf?   And while that idea could be really usefulfor getting a good golf score, (upbeat music)there's just no real payoff for my efforts.  Which focused my attention to the holy grailof any mini golf course, the arcade. It was time to recoup all the allowance moneyI've lost as a kid, starting first with Skee-Ball. And before we really see it in action,  let me first explain how it works. Because if you take away the backpack, you'll find a Frankenstein versionof a softball pitching machinethat we chopped up and modifiedso it runs just off batteries. Then there's a solenoid here that makes sure the Skee-Balls get released one at a time. So if you just turn it on, then we put a ball in here, it fires the ball like this. The coolest part here thoughis when it's placed in the backpack, you roll this pocket up to reveal the ball exit and then places water bottle here as a clever disguiseto load up to three balls at a time. Now of course, if you don't have a secret robot backpack, here's how you win this game as a mere human. For starters, if you watch the pros play, yes, there are Skee-Ball pros,  they actually aim for the 4000-point hole. And this actually makes sensebecause even if your throw is a little too weakor a little too strong, you're still getting significant points. A common mistake is to take the bait and go all or nothing by aimingfor the small 10000-point hole in the corner. The pros aim for this only in desperate situationswhere they're behind and they need big pointsto make a comeback for the win. The other big tip is to brace your leg against the base of the machine in the same spot each timeand then try and only move your arm, which will make your throws more repeatable and accuratebecause you're reducing the variablesthat could lead to air. So if you wanna win, just follow these tips and practice a bunch.  Or you could just go with my route. (upbeat music) So then when you're all done dominating, or if you think one of the workersmight be getting suspicious, you can just pick up the backpack at any pointand walk away with a bunch of tickets on your card. Up next is one of my personal favorites, basketball. In this case, the backpack is being used just to smuggle the special mechanism inside. Because to the untrained eyethis is just a normal basketballwhen in fact, (electric music)it's a robot in disguise. Now before I show you exactly how it works,  you first need to understand how these games work. Just underneath each rimis an infrared laser and a detector. And then on the front of the rim, on the other side of that metal plate, is a reflector. So when the laser beam shines straightforward, it bounces off the reflector and then the sensor's like,  \"Yep, I can see the beam. \"So when a ball goes through the hoop, it breaks the beam and the sensor's like, \"Aha! I didn't see it for a second. \"At which point it tells the gameto add two points to your total'cause that means you must have scored.  In engineering, we call this a beam brake detector, and it's the exact same concept you haveas a safety feature on your garage door. So if you really wanna destroy the high score here, the ball needs to break the beam, then somehow get out of the way so the beam reconnects and then come back and break the beam againover and over again as fast as possible. But if you think about it, the whole ball doesn't need to actually get out of the way, just the part in front of the beam itself. And how might you do that?   Well one way is to 3D print the bottom hemisphere of a basketball in two parts attached togetherthrough some linear guide rods. Then add a battery, microcontroller, and servo motorso the bottom part of the shell can translate up and down. This way it would reconnect the beamand then break it over and over again and register two points every time that happened. Now you just need a way to grab the rimso you could hang out therewhile you perform these shenanigans. And if you had some pneumatic pistonsconnected to a mini pressure and take controlledby solenoid valve triggered by an RF remote,  then you could shoot the ball normallyand then with one push of a button, piston rods would shoot out and grab the rim. And then once mischief was managed, you trigger the remote againand they would retract. Now if you just add another 3D printed hemisphere on top,  then glue on the actual basketball skin, and when you put it all togetherit would look something like this. Now if you don't happen to have a robo ball, here's a few tips that will help youget the high score for this game. Now the most important thing is you never wanna waste time waiting for a ball to roll down to you. And since these games normally come in pairs, just swipe your card on both gamesand then temporarily borrow the second set of balls. Now this will give you plenty more than you need, so just keep the balls that are the least inflated.  Now you start the game and get into a rhythmwhere you finish your shot with one handand then start grabbing and replacing the ballwith your other hand before your first shothas even gone in. Or if the rim is close and you wanna get really extreme, you can just go with a two-handed shooting strategy like this guy. But even that strategy is no matchfor my spherical transformerbecause when I'm ready to go, I just shoot the ball with one handand then hit the remote right as it's about to go in. And now as the ball just sits there articulating,  I simply watch those sweet, sweet pointsrack themselves right on up. (upbeat music) And then as soon as time's up, I just hit the remote againand the piston rods retracked. And while no one's the wiser, I've now injured my way to a butt load of ticketsand a new lifetime high score.  Next up is a really popular game called Quick Dropwhere you hit this button to releasethese ping pong balls at the right moment. And if you get all 50 ping pong balls into the bucketswithin the 22 seconds allotted without missing any shots,  then you hit the mega jackpot. But the thing is, to get all 50 balls in before the time runs out, there's essentially no margin for human error, which is good news for me because robot backpacksdon't make human errors. Now you notice when I walk up,  I can just set the backpack downand it self registers right in place. The trick here is we 3D printed an exact negative replicaof the button housing on the game. And this piston rod that pokes throughand pushes the button on the game is attached to the solenoidthat's controlled by this Arduino microcontrollerand it tells it the exact timing needed to beat the game. Now if you're trying this on your own, here's what you need to know. To successfully do this in 22 seconds, you have to drop four balls in each bucket,  except in two buckets you've gotta drop five. Now dropping five into these two buckets isn't impossible, but the timing's so tight it's really hard to pull offwithout them hitting the rim and bouncing out.  Now the jackpot starts at 500 tickets, and every time someone loses it goes up by two ticketsand each time that happens, the game gives you just a little moretotal time on the clock. And so if you ever see the jackpot at more than 625 tickets,  enough time is now on the clockwhere you only need four balls per bucket to win. And it's definitely worth trying it a few timesbecause that makes it so much easier to pull off. Alternatively, if you're too impatient to waitfor the jackpot to rise up,  you can just go to school for six yearsto get a degree in mechanical engineeringand do it this way. (upbeat music) And then even as all 554 sweet delicious ticketsare being added to your account, you can just inconspicuously walk awaywith your backpack in tow. For our next game,  we've got the perennial arcade favorite, air hockey. Now this is the most complicated of all the buildsbecause if you look closely here at the top, there's a hole in the bag for a camera to look out through. Then stripping away the backpack, you could see that camera connects to the brains,  and in this case, it's a raspberry pie, which is basically like a mini computerinstead of just an Arduino microcontrollerlike all the other builds I have used so far. The reason this one needs a bit more brain poweris because it uses computer vision to track the puck and based off the trajectory it makes a prediction, then sends instructions to rotate this servo, which is attached to an arm that moves the paddleand protects the goal. Nice. And perhaps my favorite part of this buildis that it obviously won't work if the whole thing is sliding and moving all around. So we need to anchor it down securely into position, but we need to do that quickly and discreetly. Our solution here is a pair of neodymium toggle magnets. So if you simply turn both of these knobs,  the rear end magnets move into positionand anchor it to the steel frame of the air hockey table, and it's basically cemented in place as you can see here. As for the human strategy here, playing air hockey might seem like total chaos,  but there are four simple tricksthat will pretty much guaranteeyou can beat any casual player. The first is to hold the paddle like this, and not like this. Doing that allows you to really whip the paddle aroundand gain extra speed on your shots.  The second is that for your default defensive position, you want your paddle to be out here, not right up against the goal right here. That's because this cuts down the angleand you only have to move the paddle back and forth this farto protect the whole goal, versus back and forth this far if you're against the edge.  This is the same reason goalies will come out of the goalif there's a breakaway in soccer. Even for a bing shot, you now just have to move the paddlea small distance diagonally back like this. So your paddle should essentially always stay inside a triangle like this when you're playing defense. Now when you watch professionals play, yes, there are air hockey professionals, you will see them employ both these first two tips. The third trick you'll also seeis they try and play for possession.  You wanna try and cushion your opponent's shotand gain possession of the puckso you could set up your own shot, which leads to the last tip. Mix up the straight shots and bang shots, but try and practice at least one trick shot like this one, where you hit the puck down into the corner and then when it rebounds back to you, you hit the bank shot for the win. Here's what that looks like in action. Now the real benefit of my backpack systemis you can be playing your opponent, but then when you get a phone callor you have to attend to some other important matters,  your goal is in safe hands. (upbeat music)And then at your own leisure, you can eventually just come back and finish things off. Then with the victory securely in hand, you just disengage the two toggle magnets with a twistand you're good to go. And finally, we've got the ultimate test of strength, the punching bag game. Now for this one, to make it more interesting I wanted to find and challenge the guy in the arcadewhose muscles looked the least like mine. So I stepped up first(bag bangs)and rock the 678 out of a possible 999. But then he stepped up,  (bag bangs)and rocked an 877. And since that's bigger than 678, the trash talking commenced. - Maybe if you spend a little less time at the computer and a little more time in the weight room. (Mark laughs) - So that was disappointing. But lucky for me, I had a trick up my sleeve. Like, actually, 'cause that's a fake armin order to disguise this!Now who's the one who's feelin' a little inadequate?   It's basically a bionic punching arm powered by two spring loaded pistons. To set the springs, we use a threaded rod and a drill. And once under tension, they're held in placewith a quick release mechanism I can trigger with my fingerat the exact moment I want to punch a thing.  (ball swooshes)(ball pounds)And I would classify the initial test in the lab as(plank thuds)encouraging. It's important to note to play by the rules for this game. There's no side punching, pushing, running,  kicking, or headbutting, but you'll notice there's no ruleagainst spring loaded piston punching gloves. So now that my moment of sheer domination had arrived, I stepped up(bag pounds) and rock an 838, which was less than 877, which was disappointing. And in hindsight, I should have knownit's really hard to compete with the human bodyin terms of things like punching and throwing 'cause we're just so efficient with those mechanicsand I have to sacrifice a lot of the speed and momentumof my own arm body systemwhen I'm wearing that heavy wrist mounted puncher. But you know what?   I'm a fighter, and what I lack in muscle mass I make up for in tenacity. So out of curiosity, I took a closer look to seehow the machine actually works. And it turns out it has a beam brake sensorjust like the basketball game. So as that odd-shaped metal piece, which is attached to the axle and punching bag rotates around, the beam has this tiny window to hit the sensor. You could see the sensor in the front view here. So the game cleverly measureshow many milliseconds the sensor sees the beam for, and from that it infers how quickly the bag is rotating on the axle, and therefore how hard it was punched. And this gave me an idea. So I went to the prize counterand redeemed a few of my jackpot ticketsI'd been stocking upin exchange for a PEZ dispenser.  Step one was to unwrap and eat some of the PEZ'cause they're just delicious. And then for step two, I removed the headand cut the arcade card like thisand then taped it hereand then went and tracked down my new friend. My theory was that if I extended the PEZ dispenser and modified card out like this, and then let go, the force of the spring would retract the cardand it would break the beam so fastthe machine would think it was an insanely fast punch. But would it actually work?    And it turns out, (card clicks)it absolutely does because I maxed out the machine. So yeah, use this information responsibly, kids. Now, a few years ago I made a videowhere I visited the carnival and collected data on all the gamesand then used physics to exposewhich carnival games were riggedand then showed how to beat them. So this time around instead of the carnival, I once again bribed some family friendswith unlimited Slurpees in exchange for them collecting a bunch of data at some local arcades. And in addition to uncovering which games were scams, which I'll cover in just a minute, here's what we discovered. For starters, the most popular games in the arcadewere the redemption gamesas opposed to the experience games.  And here's what I mean by that. Redemption games are the games where the goalis to win tickets. So like the coin pushers or this Plinko gameor spin the wheel. On the other end of the spectrum, you have experience games like air hockey,  Skee-Ball, or racing games. It's a trade off because the gameson this side of the spectrum give out more tickets, but it's not as much about the fun of the experience. And then in the middle of the spectrumyou have games like the ping pong drop or hit the clown that have middle of the road ticket payouts, but they're also middle of the road fun to play. Now since the games on this side were a lot more popular, they earn a lot more money for the arcadeeven when you factor in the higher ticket payouts.  We found that for a medium size arcade on a busy day, the less popular games were played 25 timesand the more popular ones could be playedup to 250 times or more. At an average gameplay of $1, that means each game makes 25 to $250 per day or about seven to $70000 per year. And finally, we found that if your sole goalwas to win tickets, coin pusher games like this Avengers oneseem to be the best return on investment.  But honestly, you can just ask one of the workers therewho are hanging out making minimum wageand are probably pretty chill, 'cause chances are they'll just tell youwhich ones they regularly see pay out the best. All right, so finally let's get to the real juicy part and talk about which games we discoveredwere basically scams. Now I actually have some experience in this areabecause a few years back I builtmy original backpack arcade robot to dominate this game.  Basically, it would sense the light turning ona few lights in front of the jackpot light, then it would hit the button with sub millisecond precision, and then we would touch nothing in between runsand yet it would alternate betweenmissing bolt shorts and long.  In other words, the timing on the jackpot lightdoesn't match up with the duration it's litand it's very different from all the other lights. You can actually test this yourselfby picking a random lightand you'll find miraculouslyyou could somehow hit that random lightevery single time you try.  Now this caused me to dig a little deeper. And after a bit of research, I was able to locate a copy of the owner's manual, at which point I discovered the arcade ownercould just manually set how often a jackpot should be won. So this time around I was curious what other games were essentially running the same scam, where you think it's a game of skill, but in reality the arcade owner is controllingwhen a jackpot's won. And as it turns out, this really popular game called Stacker employs the same trick. This other really popular game Key Masterand this Cut the Rope game are also in factrunning the same scam. In alter cases, I was able to get ahold of a copyof their owner's manual, and each one has some language around how the arcade owner can specify how often a jackpot occurs. I also found many, but not all claw machineshave language around how it will close with full strength, but then back off to a much weaker strengthof whatever is set by the owner.  For this reason, it's best to try for prizesclosest to the exit hole to minimize the amount of timeit's held in the claws. And I call these games scamsbecause they present themselves as winnable games of skill, when in reality it's essentially a random dice roll that is heavily stacked against you. And just like at the carnival, the most lucrative games are those where peopleoverestimate their chances of winningbecause they seem to get close, but they don't quite win. In gambling psychology, this is known as the near miss effect and it will lead to increased playof the slot machine. But this is much worse than a slot machinebecause at least in that case, you know it doesn't matter how you pull the leverbecause it's random chance. And on top of that, those games are regulated so there is a minimum payout required by law. So for every dollar, for example, put into a slot machine, they have to pay out at least 80 cents back to the players. But for those scam arcade games I just mentioned,  the default payout rate is on average 20 centsfor every dollar you spend, but a shady arcade owner could basically set that to zeroand no one would know, and that would be perfectly legal. And that's especially messed upbecause it's primarily played by kids.  So if you remember nothing else, just try and pick games that avoidany sort of digital winning element that can be rigged. Because in those casesyou just never really know what your chances are. These games, however, are all great optionsto at least have a better sense of your actual odds of winning. I've checked the manual for all of theseand what you see is exactly what you get. And I can vouch some arcadesare more fair about this than others. For example, my home arcade here refuses to carryany of the games that can be rigged against you,  which I think is pretty cool. However, if they happen to see this, my only suggestion is that moving forwardthey should probably institutea no backpacks allowed policy. And perhaps also, don't let people redeem ticketsfor PEZ dispensers.  This is a dad finder. It was made by a dad who's also a pilot, so his kids always know which directionand how far away he iswhen he's traveling around the world. And this contraption feeds your dog with a pull of a leverand went on to get successfully funded as a six-figure kickstarter campaign. So what do these and tens of thousands of more projectsjust like them have in common?   Well, they were all designed by folkswho took my creative engineering class at studio. com.  The best part about being a maker and an engineeris you can come up with clever solutionsfor your real life challenges, like winning more tickets at the arcade. It's like a superpower, but it's a superpower you can learnand I love to see others catch that spark, which is why a few times a year I teach a month long creative engineering course, and enrollment for the latest session is open right now. Now you might be like, \"Hold up, Mark. Didn't you just launch the CrunchLabs Build Box?   That monthly toy that gets delivered to a kidwhere you build it together with them on video and then explore all the juicy physics that make it work?   Why are you now back to talking about this class?   \"And it's like, yeah, I did. But the problem is that we sold outof the certified butt ton of subscriptionswe had in stock in like less than a week.  So I don't really wanna talk about thatuntil we have more in stock, which will for sure happen in time for the holidays. So if you wanna guarantee you get dibs on one for Christmasbefore we sell out again, you better get yourself on the waitlistat crunchlabs. com ASAP.  And now you might be thinking, \"All right, but what's the difference between the box and your class?   \"And the answer is the CrunchLabs monthly Build Boxis sort of the first step. It's a monthly build I walk you throughwhere I teach you to think like an engineer. So if you're teenager-ish all the way down to way younger,  it's perfect for you. You gotta get on that waitlist. But if you're teenager-ish all the way up to way older, the Creative Engineering class is perfect for youbecause the class is more open-endedand it covers my full engineering design process all the way from how I come up with an idea to prototyping, to finalizing the build, and then giving it character. I show you everything that I'm thinking, everything that I'm doing, and I do it three times. Over the course of a month you're gonna watch me designing create three totally original builds, and I'm gonna guide you through finishingthree creative builds of your own. And this is an online class, so you can take it from anywhereand work it around your schedule, but it's fully immersive and intensive.  So whether you're working professional, a complete beginner, or an experienced engineer, this class has been designed to meet you wherever you're atand then level up your skills. So go to studio. com/markroberor use the link in the video descriptionto see what other people had to say about their experience and then enroll. And I'll see you in class. Thanks for watching. (light music)\n","- I built a new massive secret labthat the average person will never findbecause the only way inis through this fake old, dusty office. But I'm gonna give you guys a hint. (eagle sliding and clicking) (soft mysterious music)And if you want a small taste for what's inside, well this is a tennis ball cannon, and this is my childhood hero Nitrofrom the TV show, \"American Gladiators. \" - [Announcer] Nitro. - And he's gonna try and shoot mewith a tennis ball cannon from the showas I try and not get shot. The only problem is I've made some modifications to the cannonand it shoots tennis balls stronger than the original. Like a lot stronger. (laughs) Dude.  But before we see if I actually liveI'd like to introduce youto my brand new Willy Wonka factory for engineeringI've been secretly designing and constructingover the past year and a half.  Not only have I been making all the buildsfor my YouTube videos here, but it's also the birthplacefor the most ambitious thing I've ever done, which I'll show you in a few minutes. It's got secret passageways and $10000 in a glass suitcase,  if you can fire a tennis ball into the bullseye, the world's longest Hot Wheels track, rooms that magically reveal themselves, and a handful of some new engineering inventionsthat I came up with just for the lab.  Since I was like eight years oldI've had this dream to design and build my own warehouse, and this is it. Welcome to CrunchLabs. So today, I'm gonna walk you through my 10 favorite things about this place, and then at the end of the videoI'll explain how you can actually come out hereto build with me and my team for a day. With that, let's jump right into number 10, which is basically a way better version of a fireman's pole.  Now, the best thing about a fireman's poleis that it's more exciting than using the stairs, but other than that, they kind of suck. I either do the thing where I hit the ground too fast and burn my hands, or I do the thing where I sortof squeak my way down and I still burn my hands. So I thought, what if you could walk off the balconyholding a rope that ran through some pulleys and was connected to some kind of counterweight?   Well, that works great, and you land at the perfect speedas long as you weigh just a little bit morethan the counterweight. But unfortunately, if you weigh less,  you're not gonna go anywhere, and if you weigh too much more, you're still gonna land with a crash. If only there was a way to have a perfect soft landingno matter what you weigh. Well, it turns out there is.  Using the power of pneumatics. This is actually the same tube and piston we usedfor the last devil's toothpaste explosion. Only this time we just let the natural restriction of the air having to squeeze by the piston slow you down. So instead of the fireman's pole, we got the fireman's piston. It's so fun, and you basically feel like a superhero every time you use it, but more importantly, it works the same no matter what you weigh. Here's a family friend who weighs half as much as I doand she sticks the landing like a pro just the same.  Next up, if we walk over here, we see number ninewhich is the Nerf armory. (singer vocalizing) (angelic music)This of course allows me to pick my weapon of choiceand then to perch myself up here on the balcony to keep an eye on my team and motivate anyonethat I think just isn't working hard enough. (gun humming and popping)But you'll noticethere's a second fireman's piston over there.  Only the rope on this one has a footholdand lowers half as slow, which means on the way downyou can get real Jason Bourne with things. Then number eight, we've got this cool hangout areaon the balcony overlooking the workspace.  Of course for entertainment up here we got Chopsticks. Hey, Chopsticks, play me a banger. - [Chopsticks] You got it, Mark. - (kiss smacks) The perfect choice.  - [Voice] Enchante. - [Mark] Then right here we've got an original blueprintfrom a \"Mythbusters\" episode, a couch that transforms into a couch plusas well as the chair that transforms into a chair plus.  Then my super cool brother Brianmade this super cool, old school, retro arcade gameas a lab warming giftso I can play all the classics. (playful music)Then we stole this claw machine from a Denny's and filled it with Phat Gus plushies, and it hides one of the secret passages into the space. But I'll show you that one in a second. And now it's time for number seven, which next to the fireman's piston showcases my second favorite wayto make it down to the ground floor. (Mark exhales)(birds chirping) Now, don't worry, folks, no Mark Robers were hurtin the filming of the segmentbecause down below there was a shipping containerwith a giant foam pit.  Nailed it. And in addition to allowingfor emergency second floor exits, it also allows you to up your Nerf battle game. (gun popping)But importantly the shipping container is on wheels which means we can wheel it backto its natural habitat in the arena room. And giant foam pits are awesome for many reasons, but foremost among them is if you have a buddywho's a professional ultimate Frisbee player he could toss you some throws, so you can try and be just like him. (upbeat music)♪ Oh yeah ♪(people clapping and laughing) Just be prepared that when he does it after youhe's gonna make it look much cooler. (camera clicks)(people laughing) Coming in at number six is all the engineering Easter eggsthat we've hidden around here. As an example, let's take the bathroom, which I think we could all agree is usually pretty boring.  First off, we found this regal portraitof what is ostensibly one of Phat Gus's forebears. But if you look closely hereyou'll see there's a magnetic contact switchand then a magnet on the seat lid.  That's because men are pigs, and as long as the sensor detectsthe seat is in the up positionit will deploy the solenoid and keep the door closed. And now with nowhere to go, you've got plenty of timeto reevaluate your terrible life choices.  (door rattling)And then I've always loved the ideafrom this \"Far Side\" cartoon, which is like a hand wash detector. And the best thing about being an engineeris if there's a thing that doesn't exist and you want it to exist, you can just make it exist. So we have a limit switch herethat gets triggered on the flush, and then a capacitive touch sensor herethat knows if the faucet's been touched.  And then finallya hall effect sensor here that tells us if the door's open. And so if the Arduino under here detectsthat the toilet is flushed and then the door has been openedwithout the signal the sink has been touched between those two eventsthen this flashing light goes offand everyone knows who not to high five. (sighs)Honorable mention in the bathroom is the air freshener which is actually filled with glitter bomb fart spraybecause subversion of expectations equals comedy. Then coming into number fiveis how we actually keep the lab location super secret.  If you were to walk in off the streetor deliver a package here, this is what you'd see. And clearly who whoever works hereis not who you would expect would be hiding a high-tech state-of-the-art Willy Wonka engineering lab, but when you turn this eagle and the bookshelf slides overrevealing a secret passageway down a hallwayending on a dope view of my work bench.  But there's an even more secret entrancehidden in this room and you can only access itby putting a quarter in here and then pushing this button. (intriguing music)Climbing this ladder not only leads you to the underside of the claw machine where you can put yourself rightin the mix of things, (plush thunks)but then pushing right here means you've taken the shortcutstraight up to the cool balcony hangout area. And I brought my niece and nephew out here to tour the place, and this was perhaps their favorite part, which just might have cemented my statusin my ongoing quest to be the favorite uncle. Were it not for my regrettable actions in the foam pit at the conclusion of the tour. (Mark screaming)Now I know what you're thinking. It's not exactly secretnow that I've shown 20 million peopleexactly what the secret entrance lobby looks like. But after this I'm gonna give this place a complete makeover. So next time you find yourselfwaiting your turn at the barberor perhaps stuck in the waiting room at the dentist office, you might wanna get upand just start moving everything around on display because the entrance to the CrunchLabjust might be behindthat oversized tooth decay poster hanging on the wall. All right, so before we getto the final four in the countdown,  like the world record Hot Wheels track or the Hidden Museumor even how you could come out here yourself, I need to tell you about what else we do hereor why we even call it CrunchLabs. Three of my favorite things are teaching,  coming up with new ideas, and getting people stoked about science and engineering, especially the young folk. And so for over a year, in addition to building this placeI've been working on a way to combine those three things.  And here it is. It's called the CrunchLabs Build Boxand it's a monthly tour that gets delivered to youwhere we build it togetherand then explore all the juicy physics that make it work.  For a long time, I've had parents reach out to me and say, \"My kid is 8 or 12 years old, and they love your videos. They want to be an engineer like you. How do I foster that passion?   Like what's the first step?   \" And I've just never had a great answerfor that specific situation until now. Let's do an unboxing and see what's inside. Oh, and by the way, this is preciselywhere the toys are designed, right here in the CrunchLab.  In fact, this first oneis this super cool rapid fire disc launcher. As you know, I love to take something humans doand then build a robot to help me do it way better.  Like with kicking field goals, skipping rocks, setting up dominoes, bowling, golfing, or even throwing bullseyes. (bell dings) Well, now you get to have the same feelingand build a machine that gives you superpowersversus someone trying to throw this Frisbeewith their own lame arm. What kind of superpowers?   Well, I'm glad you asked.  (explosion booms)(intense action music)(kid shouts)(upbeat music) We engineered the crud out of this thingto optimize six rapid fire shots for maximum glide with maximum accuracy. You will dominate any mere humanwho tries to challenge your creation. So when you open the box, the first thing you see is a link to a video where I not only walk you throughhow to put it together step-by-stepbut then we talk through all the physicsand engineering juicy nuggetsthat makes something like this work. It's like unlockingyour own secret Mark Rober video every month.  Only it's better because you're right there in the trenchesconstructing your own build alongside meallowing the engineering discoveries to really sink in. It basically bumps into all these stationary air molecules and it causes it to deflect up. So for example, in the disc launcherwe learn all about how useful flywheels areand then each month you earn a gear badgewith a different engineering principle,  and at the end of 12 months, it will make a really cool gear train like this, at which point you unlock my signatureto make it all official. So the first video is up in its entirety for freeover on the new CrunchLabs  YouTube channel.  And I'll put a link in the video descriptionso you can see for yourselfthat we're not cutting any corners here. And then in addition to the video, as backup, we've also got some simple booklet instructions.  And as a nod to Team Trees, Team Seas, and my buddy MrBeast, we maximize for sustainabilityin our material and packaging choices. Even the bags inside are compostable. And the disc launcher is just the tip of the iceberg.  In another boxwe built this super cool Rube Goldberg catapultand the gear badge here is for projectile motion. Here's a robot guaranteed to outdraw your brotherwhere we learn about linkages.  Or there's this coin spinner machinethat gives you the superpowerof spinning a coin better than any human. And there we learned about ratchets. And you get two of them so you can competein a \"Beyblade\" style fight to the last coin standing.  There's a bunch morebut I want it to be a surprise for you. So rest assured, we designed our hearts outon every single last one. And just like it says on the box, my goal with CrunchLabs is to help you think like an engineer. That means you think critically, you could break a problem down into manageable steps. Thinking like an engineer makes you a better soccer playeror piano practicer or math studier because you're resilient.  You know it's not only okaybut it's important to fail a bunchin order to hit that big breakthrough. That's why it's called CrunchLabs. So we can crunch and break and fail things so we can learn fast. That's literally the processof how I make every single one of my robotsthat eventually works out awesomely. There's just no better teacher than a good crunch along the path to finding the best designand any good engineer knows that's true. So if you wanna fight that summer brain drainand embark on this yearlong journey with me,  go to crunchlabs. com/markrober. Use the link in the video description, where, as an early adopter special, we're giving away two months free. Supplies are definitely limited on this first run,  so if you don't wanna miss out, be sure to go check out our lovely website after this. Speaking of which, I've just got a shout out Shopify'cause that's how we built it. They were super helpful, and I've been friends with them for a long time, and they give you all the tools to turn your idea into an actual business. All right, so continuing on with our top 10 listof the coolest things here at CrunchLabs. At number four, if you look right here, we've got the start and finish line of the world's longest Hot Wheels trackat over a half a mile. Here we go. (upbeat music)Now the Crunch Labs is big, but not exactly half a mile big which is why we had to employ some clever switchbacksto do the trick. But after doing one, we realizedit only got us like 10% of the way there, so we scaled it up to fill an entire wall.  Now we're employing over 75 of the officialHot Wheel speed boosters to help manage the balanceof our potential and kinetic energiesbecause that's allowed in the rules.  And it's just kind of funto watch it go back and forth and back and forth. (car rattling)(upbeat music)(car rattling) And so after we make it through the mouse hole(car rattling) and travel around the bend, we complete the loopand set an official new world record. Next up at number three, if you press this button, you obviously shouldn't press,  then these mirrors become see-throughrevealing sort of a storage roomof a bunch of my previous builds. And if you come through this incognito dooryou could even see them up closeincluding the automatic bullseye dartboard,  all four glitter bombs, the original double iPad sweatshirt Halloween costumefrom my very first video, and a handful of other classics as well. Now, before we wrap it up with the last two coolest things about this place(bell ringing)I just want to submit for honorable mention, not only this bike with a legit train horn attachedwhen the bell just isn't cutting it. . .  (horn hooting)Dah, that's loud. But also to the brainstorm roomthat has walls covered in floor to ceiling whiteboards,  which is a feature I stole from my favorite conference roomsat both NASA and Apple, as well as this decorativemassive ant farm we built for the wall. It's fascinating to see how they organize and work together,  like how both ant coloniesinstinctively have made a graveyard in the cornerfor all their fallen comrades. And now at number two, we're back with the tennis ball cannon. After Nitro put it through the wall. . .  Oh, it's literally smoking. We decided to give it the half inch plywood test. And you can see it passed with no issues. (Mark laughing) Which meant we were left with just one moreofficial scientific investigation to conduct, the watermelometer. (intriguing music)(glass shattering) (ball whooshing)(watermelon splashing)(cannon pops) The cool thing here isyou might have noticed this glass suitcaseattached to a chain with $10000 cash in here. The deal is you could practice as much as you want, and I've even set up some additional targets for that purpose. (cannon pops) (gong clangs)But everyone gets only one official shot in their whole lifeto hit the bullseye and make it down the tubeand into the box to unlock the $10000 suitcase.  So for the avoidance of doubtwhen you're ready for your official shotyou just sign the wall and now the pressure's really on. (ball whooshes and clicks)And as for Nitro. . . - I'm gonna be your worst nightmare.  - (laughs) Oh, I love it. He's talking trash. Even though I did make him reduce the pressureto one-fifth full power. You suck, Nitro. - [Nitro] You're going down. (growls) - I still took a beating. (Mark screams)- [Nitro] Oh, that was a. . . (Mark screams)- But at least I survived. Retreat. (Nitro laughs)And finally, the number one coolest thing about this place is you can actually come here. Every month before we ship out the CrunchLab build boxes, I essentially cover my eyes, throw a dart, and then I open whatever box I hit and set this inside.  It's called the platinum ticket. And if you happen to be the one who gets the boxwith the ticket inside that month, then you and your family get to come out hereand spend a day with me and my team making whatever crazy idea it isyou want us to build together. And because I repeat this every monththat means you have a new chance to win every month. And you know I'm no statisticianbut supplies are kind of limited on this first run.  So early adopters really increase their chancesof winning this thing right outta the gate. You can see a linkto all the official rules in the video description. Whoa. So if you needed one more reason to get your Build Box so you could have fun hanging out with mea bunch this summerwhile you learned to think like an engineer, then there it is. So just head to crunchlabs. com/markroberor use the link in the video description to get that early adopter special of two months free. I've found that thinking like an engineerand having more of an understandingof the amazing world around usis such a lovely lens from which to experience life.  And creating that spark in the next generationof big problem solversis why I can't wait for you guys to see these dang boxes. Thanks so much for your support over the years and thanks for watching. (whooshing)(bell dings)(. com pops)\n","- I had 100 cockroaches here and I placed them in thisJames Bond style contraption that turns this ball screw andforces them out after a specified time delay. And then I put it in a lunchbox for camouflageand then I release them in this office. Now you might think, that's not very nice, Mark. Some people are afraid of cockroaches.  Trust me, I know. (man yelling)And that's exactly the pointbecause this isn't just any office. This is ground zero for one of those terrible call centersthat scams people of their life savings. A year ago when I released this video about inadvertently stumbling onto the low-level thugsin this international scam operation, I said we were gonna glitter bomb our wayall the way to the top, even if it meant taking this fightto the other side of the globe. And so after a year and a half of planning, we infiltrated not one, not two, not three, but four different scam call centers.  We released cockroaches, smoke bombs, stink bombs, glitter bombs, and then, of course, we hacked their CCTV so we could watchthe whole thing unfold in real time. So buckle up because this is the wild conclusion to thismultinational adventure. And please watch to the end because there's something you can actually do to help put the nail in the coffin of thesefour massive call centers. Now, why would we go after this $20 billion scam industry?   Well, we're doing it for the 60 million people who've lost moneyto scammers in the past year. But more specifically, we're doing it for Bessie, who you might recall from my previous video when I detailed exactly how one of these scams work. - [Scammer] You're like my granny, Mrs. Bessie. Do you know this?   - [Bessie] Yes. - [Scammer] She was like one of my closest friends. - [Bessie] Aw. - [Scammer] I used to share each and everything with her. - [Mark] Basically, it starts with an email or a spam call. Then they pretend to be Amazon or Microsoft and they tell the victim they've been charged $200 for something. But if you call back, you can dispute the charge. Then after they call, they eventually get on the victim's computer, and importantly, have the victim type the $200refund amount into a bogus form. - [Scammer] Please enter your refund amount.  - Only they take over and secretlytype the amount of $20000and then they hit enter real quick. - [Scammer] Check everything. Is it correct?   - [Bessie] Oh, no. This is a mistake!Oh, I screwed up!- [Scammer] Oh, Jesus. - [Bessie] It was supposed to be $200 in there.  Oh God almighty. I'm exhausted!I can't do this!My mind is absolutely fried. - [Scammer] Ma'am, please check your account. Please check your account. Did you really receive that money in your account?   - [Mark] Then they take her to a totallyfake spoofed bank account pagewhere it looks like because of Bessie's mistake,  they just sent her $20000 instead of $200.- [Scammer] Oh my God. Plus $20000.- [Bessie] Yeah. - [Scammer] Please save my job, ma'am. If I'm not earn for my family, my family will die due to hunger, due to starvation. Please, ma'am.  - Yes, of course! - Please don't cry. - What should I do?    - Please don't cry, ma'am. - [Scammer] I really feel real bad for you. You're also like my grandmother. - [Bessie] You know, I'm an honest person. - [Scammer] You're making me cry now. I'm getting attached to you. - [Bessie] Now how do I fix this?   - [Mark] And now you can see howhe's weaponized her empathy.  Now fix her mistake, how she'd be willing to go to the bank and withdraw what shethinks is an extra $20000 in cash, when in reality, it's $20000 of her hard earned savings. And she's gonna send it in the mail to a heartless scammer. Now, in case you think they've gottena lot nicer over the last year, here's another call from a few weeks ago where the scam is to pretend they're from the government and there's somemissing taxes that are owed. - [Patient] I just retired let's just say last Februaryand then I was diagnosed with breast cancer in August. So my retirement hasn't been very good so far.  And after today, I know it's not your fault, but it's worse now. - [Scammer 2] Oh, I'm so sorry you hear that. - [Patient] I would rather just pay it. Otherwise, I'll be worrying about itand I'll be worse in my health, you know what I mean?    Or even if I have to pay it in two halves. - [Mark] So the scammer places her on hold to talk with theauthorities to see if there's just something that could bedone to help her out. - [Scammer 2] Thank you so much for holding the line, ma'am. I just had a word with the higher authorities and I informed them about your situation andthey're also concerned about your health. - [Mark] So concerned, in fact, she'll only have to send these scammers $2000.- [Scammer 2] Actual amount found outmissing in the taxes was £1, 489.  - Now last year's operation was effectivein getting a handful of people involved in this scamnot only covered in glitter, but also arrested. But the problem was we discovered these were just thelow-level mules and supervisorswho then send the bulk of themoney back to the actual scammers in India. And while we did turn over all the intel we gathered to the five major government agencies thatreached out to us, to truly avenge Bessie, our goal was to take our glitter all the way to the top andeither temporarily disrupt or possibly even permanently shutdown a few of these terrible call centers. It'd be like a special operation.  And every special operation needs a special ops team, a target, and a plan. For the team, I turn back to my good friend, Jim Browning, who you recall from last year as a YouTube channel thatspecializes in reversing the connection to the scammers'computers and gaining access to their CCTV footage.  - [Scammer 3] Is there anything else you wanna ask?   - [Jim] Yeah, I wanna know why you scam people. - [Mark] And then another YouTube channelcalled Trilogy Media would be the boots on the groundin India implementing the pranks, but more on them later. For the target, together, we were able to locate and gather tons ofincriminating information onfour different scam call centers.  For starters, there's Met Technologies located in Kolkata, India on the 5th floor of this building. They've been in operation over 12 yearsand they've got over 1000 agents. Their owner is Mr. Kunal Guptaand you can even see the rest of their leadership team hereon their public website. And you might ask, why would a scam call center have a public website?    And the answer is they all do because they have a very smallpercentage of their employeesdo legitimate call center work. So if they get rated by the authorities, they can point to that small group and say their hands areclean while the real money making operationruns here behind a secure door.  Then we found VRM, also located in Kolkata, on the 12th floor of this building. They also have over 1000 agents and they've been inoperation for six years and they run 24 hours a day in threeshifts to target people in time zones all across the globe. Oh, and allow me to introduce to the world,  Rajesh and Vidya Goenka, the husband and wife co-owners. Next was Ansh Info Solutions onthe 5th floor of this building. They also run three shifts 24 hours a dayand they've been up and running for 11 yearswith all their key info shown here. They're located just a block away from VRM.  In fact, all three of these centers were located within just a fewmiles of each other here in Kolkata, India, which is a hotspot for scam call centers like this. And finally, there was one more we located, but we're not releasing public information on them yet. And you'll see why in just a little bit. And so once we'd amassed mountains of evidence against all four of them thanks to Jim's handiwork, we hired 10 private investigator typesto apply for jobs at each of these centers, and after a few weeks, we had 'em all in place. Now, in order for them not to arouse suspicion, they had to legitimately scam some people, but we told them to remember the victim's information and then we would reach out and double any money that was lost. And at first, one of our agents in the VRM call center went againstprotocol and used his phone to capture some footage for usof the bathrooms and the server rackand whatever this is. But they must've seen him filming with his phone on their CCTV because the next day, some of the security team showed up at his house. Now, luckily, his roommate knew to lie and say he wasn't home and he wasable to escape through the back alley, but they stayed out in front of his house all day and latersent this message saying the director wanted to speak with him and they would pay him handsomely. And of course, he didn't need to be scared. They were just simply curious what kind of evidence he'dgathered against them already. So from that point on, we reiterated to the remaining nine to lay really low like asleeper cell until we were ready to activate the plan. And speaking of the plan,  now that we saw what we were up against, we knew we'd have to go full James Bond Q-mode with somehigh-tech gadgetry that could make it past security. (explosion)Which is why this first prank is just a water bottle. Kind of. I mean, it can function as a normal water bottle,  but if you unscrew just this portion of the lid, it reveals a trough. And if you put military grade putrid smelling stuff in thattrough and then screw the lid back on fully, it creates a perfect seal and you can't smell anything. But then at the exact precise momentyou want to release a cloud of death,  you just twist the lid like this, allowing the smell to escapethrough these holes and fill the room. And we're using a water bottlebecause from looking at the CCTV footage, we know they allow them to have water bottles at their desk. So they'll be able to sneak them past security. Plus, no one's going to suspect that's the origin of the smell.  Next up, if you take some hand soap and add just a few drops of thesame kitchen grade food coloringwe used on the devil's toothpaste explosion, (crowd cheering)then when you wash your hands, it will leave them stained for at least a day. - [Worker] Oh crap. - [Mark] We'll leave this in the bathroom, and as a bonus,  we'll learn exactly who does and doesn't wash their hands. This next one is the most simple, but also perhaps the most effective. You take a box of Sudafed and then print out and paste onsome of these labels and convert it to a box of Viagra. Then, importantly, you add the name of the boss of the scam call center to thebox like it's his prescription.  And then you leave it in the bathroomnext to your blue soap. Next up is that custom built boxthat can store cockroaches in it. So after a predetermined time delay, the microcontroller will trigger the stepper motor, which causes the wall to slide along this ball screw. That means if you disguise it in a lunchbox, then nothing happens until the timer expires,  and then suddenly, you get a bunch of cockroaches crawling out of a lunchbox. Although you can put more than just cockroaches in here. And some other ideas we had were bees'cause we heard India has some species that don't actuallysting as well as possibly rats because we already knew fromlooking at their security footage that once released,  the rats could make themselves right at home. And using a lunchbox for camouflage is once again astrategic choice because wealready knew from our recon work, they always make it past security 'cause no one actuallychecks what's inside. Next up, I love the idea of the chaosthat could result if we set off a smoke bomb, but we were concerned that might be crossing a line if the room was too small because like the glitter bombs, I want everything I do to be exciting, but at the end of the day, relatively harmless. So instead, we found these micro foggers that are basicallylike massive vape pens. We also noticed motorcycle helmets were allowed onto thefloor and past security. So the plan was to put it inside a helmet like this and then it would also detonate itself based on a timer. And finally, as the piece de resistance, we're gonna deliver them a package, only this isn't an ordinary package, It's glitter bomb 4.0, which of course, as we all know is equipped with a pound of the world'sfinest glitter and an uncharitable amount of fart spray.  - I can still smell it. (man coughing)- [Mark] And so now that our team, target, and plan were in place, after one and a half years of prep work, it was time to avenge Bessieand execute the special operation. Step one was getting the Trilogy Media guys all the way overto India with all the contraptions stored securely in their luggage. - [Youtuber] Oh my God. Stepping foot on Indian soil. - [Mark] Now safely on the ground, step two was to go pick up those stingless beesthat we could put in the lunchbox. But once they'd arrived to the beekeeper, they found out you can't just take a few bees, but you have to take the whole hive.  - [Youtuber] Dude, no. They're gonna get out!- I'm not afraid. - [Mark] Also, apparently, there's no such thing as stingless bees. - [Youtuber] Oh my God!Oh (bleep)!(group laughing)- [Mark] So we punted on that ideaand headed to an open air market where we could at least secure some rats. By the way, the Trilogy Media YouTube channel is composed of Ashton, who's a former magician, and Art, who played professional basketballin Russia for eight years. They're just an incredible duo. And speaking of incredible things,  this is a good time to point out that the real people ofIndia were just so freaking lovely. It's true that nearly every scam call you getoriginates from that country, but everyone in India hates these scammers, too. They are a tiny, tiny fraction of the total population and no one wants to bedefined by the worst in their midst.  Most people we interacted with therehad hearts more like Johnny, who's an honorary member of the team and a reformed scammerwho's made it his life's mission to do whatever he can totake these guys down, even if that means working some back channels to get ourhands on 100 cockroaches. - Alright, let's go. - [Mark] So with the goods procured,  it was time to meet up with our sleep arrangementsto the hotel to do some final prep on the contraptions, which went about as well as expected. - Seriously, though, are we gonna test it right here?   Right here?   - Yeah. - We can't do it in the bathroom?   - [Youtuber 2] 16, 17. - [Youtuber 3] Yeah, no, get 'em in. Get 'em in. All of 'em, yeah, yeah. The more the merrier. (group yelling) - [Youtuber] Don't scream. It's okay!It's okay!- [Youtuber] Grab, grab, grab, grab, grab!(bleep) stop it!(bleep)No, in, in, in!(bleep)God!(bleep)Grab him!No, no, no, no!Please, please, please, please, please! (group laughing)- Okay, pause. Pause. Accounted for, right?   Everyone?   - I swear, I would not let you down. - We decided the first call centerwe'd hit would be Ansh and wewere feeling optimistic about our chances. And that's exactly when our special operation received its first major blow. So apparently, there's this WhatsApp group that 55000scammers all across India belong toso the different scam call centers cancommunicate with each other. And because Johnny was still a member of this group from hisformer days, he saw this message pop up. \"Two of us in the town of Kolkata have seen cuss word Trilogy people. We followed them, but the driver drove the carvery fast to the Salt Lake side. There was two Indians with themand they were shooting a movie. \"So apparently some scammers had recognized Art and Ashton atthe market as the Trilogy Media YouTube guys'cause they've confronted a lot of scammers in their five years of making videos. Now, thankfully just outta habit, Johnny was driving in a way that would make it hard foranyone to tail them, but they still were able to pinpoint their hotel locationwithin about a half a mile. But then it got much worse. \"Might be there working with the FBI, so I request all of our brothers to have an eye in Salt Lake. So whenever you see them, you shoot them. \"Which was super devastating because it seemed pretty clearto me that we'd have to scrap the whole operation becausewhile the mission was important, it definitely wasn't worth anyone getting hurt. But when I brought this up to the guys, they'd already discussed it amongst themselves and decided this was a cause they were passionate enough aboutthat they were willing to accept some risks. So we decided moving forward, Art and Ashton wouldn't step a footoutside their hotel room. And that's when the second major blow came becauseapparently the group text warning spooked the call scamcenter so much they just changed up everyone's assignments and they were planning on moving all three of our sleeperagents to a new floor where there was no CCTV coverage. But this is where we had a stroke of luckbecause at the last minute, Johnny thought to have another one of his reformedscammer friends apply for a job. And because he had so much experience on his resume,  they hired him on the spotand gave him a more highly trusted role, which meant he could be the oneto smuggle in all our gadgets. And so with that, he loaded up, headed in for battle, and an hour later, we had a man on the inside. And by the way, now that we're inside, I'll give you a very quick crash course on what we'velearned about how these scam centers operate after watching them for so long. First of all, 90% of the victims are 65 years old or above. - [Caller] I don't understand that. I don't understand all of this. - [Mark] They really only make callsduring the US working day hoursand not on the weekends 'cause that maximizes theirchance the person who picks up will be retired.  This is why you never get scam calls on Sunday. They don't have anyone even working the phones. In fact, many of 'em have an auto dial prompt that says press one ifyou're over 65 years old, and if you press anything else, it just hangs up. The most common scam is the Amazon refund scam, but they also pretend to be Microsoft, McAfee,  Norton Antivirus, the IRS, and your bank, and on and on. It's always changing, but it's also always something you've heard of to try andbuild trust right out of the gate. If you wanna know how much they make, well, that information unfortunately is securely held on theboss's computer, so we can't get to it.  Although I suppose if you hadaccess to the internal cameras, you could just watch the boss type his password and thenyou'd be able to access their master tracking spreadsheets, which is what we did and how we knowthese large call centers make $60000 per day.  That's $18 million a year. An opener will take the initial calls and they make anaverage of $7000 a month. Then if they keep the victim on the phone long enough, they hand it over to a closer and they make on average$15000 a month. They never say the word scam or victim, instead referring to them as sales and customers.  That way they just seem more like a normal office. Although what I think does that job more convincingly areall the walls plastered with inspirational corporate words, like synergy, or management, or process. So that's your crash course on how they operate.  And the FTC has put out a list of four signs to help spot ascam and four things you can do to protect against themand I'll link to it in the video description. And so now without further ado, we kicked things off with the stink bomb water bottle. And while that was marinating, he went to the bathroom and dropped off the hand soap and the special medication with theboss's name written on the front. And it didn't take long for us toget our first hit on the smell. What was great though is they all kind of covered theirnoses subtly in silence so thepeople next to them wouldn't feel accused. Well, for the most part.  Then, a few minutes later, we had our first bathroom customerwho clearly doesn't wash her hands after using the restroom. But then we had a second chancewith an apparently more hygienic scammer, and this time, we struck pay dirt as he comes out trying tofigure out what the heck just happened. And five minutes later, you could see him still trying to work it out. And not long after that,  we got our first mention of thespecial package in the bathroom. - [Worker] There's Viagra in the bathroom. - [Worker 2] Viagra?   - [Worker] Yeah. - [Mark] The audio cut out here, but our agent told us they were laughing and wondering howthe boss could possibly leave that lying around.  Although it certainly doesn't feel too far off brand givenhe uses this as his profile pick on Facebook. And at this point, our agent placed and then triggered the time delaycountdown on the cockroach, rat, and smoke bomb traps so he can now safely make his getaway. - [Jaani] Come on in, man.  Oh. - [Secret Agent] Go, go, go, go. - [Jaani] You okay?   - [Secret Agent] Yeah. - [Jaani] You're safe. - [Secret Agent] Yeah. I thought they were just following me. - [Mark] And since they of coursehave no idea what's about to happen, they're still just casually talking about the bathroom. - [Worker] There's Viagra in the bathroom.  I think I know who needs it so bad. - [Mark] And then a few moments later, the first boxes must have triggered 'causethis guy notices a cockroach and nopes his way out of there. And then he's quickly followed by the second dude. And I love it 'cause now you justrandomly see cockroaches start coming in frame.  And so now that they know what they're up against, they call in the reinforcements with the mop. But it looks like he missed one. Or two. Or three. Actually, four. Scratch that. Five. And then as if perfectly on cue,  right as the mop guy finishes his cleanup, the smoke begins. And this causes quite a commotion and drawsquite a crowd and it takes them a while. They're eventually able to pinpoint the source of the smokeand gingerly take it off the premises. Followed soon thereafter by our rat friends.  And this is possibly my favorite clip of the whole nightwhere you see a cockroach lead the way and wander all aroundas they argue and try and make senseof what in the world is possibly happening. And by this point, you could tell the boss is pretty surethey're under attack, but just to remove any sense of doubt,  we sent them one final package. And they almost opened it right there, but I guess with everything else that had already happenedso far that night, he took it downstairs. And then this happened. (alarm ringing) - [Package] Ha ha!You guys give up?   Or are you thirsty for more?   - [Worker] There might be a camera in there. - [Mark] Yeah, in fact, there's four of 'em and they're uploading thisfootage to the cloud. - [Worker] It smells!(box spraying) - [Worker] It just blasted and. . . - [Package] Five, four, three, two, one.  Activation complete. Recovery sequence initiated. - [Worker] It smells so bad.  Yes, it smells bad!(box spraying)Very smelly!- So after our incredibly successful special operation, we waited to see what the response would be. And we didn't have to wait long. \"Yesterday, those cuss words sent Ansh Solutions a package bomb and it exploded and there was a bad smell andsprinkler water or whatever it was. These guys are playing good with us. I'm reminding you guys, they must be in between us, we don't even know. \"And now we had 'em 'cause they were paranoid and they didn't know which of their employees might've been compromised. \"Check the lunch boxes, pocket bags, shoes, ladies purse as well. Even check the water, whether there's some color mixed in it. \"I assume he's referring to the soap dye here. \"But be cautious, guys. Seriously.  They came to bad word all of usand they're still trying to bust us. \"After that, there were a few more death threats, so we didn't think it was safe enough to launch our attackson the other three centers to try and get them shut down. But the beautiful thing is we didn't have to. \"Big centers in Kolkata and Delhiare closed from today as well as Monday as per the information I got from all my friends. \"We had created enough confusion and mass panic that not onlydid the other three centers get shut down, but we got all the large scam centers all across India shutdown for a few days, too. And if you add it up, that means those tiny cockroaches stopped $2 million from going from the victims to the scumbags. And I would say that's the perfect ending, but it actually gets even a little better. Once Ashton and Art were safely back home on American soil, they decided to troll that text group with those 55000scammers by uploading this gem to the chat.  - Surprise, surprise, scammers!Art and Ashton over here. - No matter how many numbers you removed from this group, we're still watching. Not only that, we've also downloaded every single person's contactinformation, all 57000 of them inside this group.  We have every single one of those contact information. We're submitting it to the FBI and the United States and theCBI here in India. So you guys better run and you better watch out. (explosion)- [Mark] And so if you wanna see howquickly the scammers startedremoving themselves from the chat groupas well as a lot more details of all their work on theground over in India, you should go check out their video.  And not surprisingly, Ansh and the other scam call centerseventually opened back up, albeit this time with much tighter security. But they still didn't and still don't realize probably tillthis moment that we have access to their live camera feeds. So Jim improvised a bit, calling them out by their real names without giving away the fact he was just looking at them on the camera. - [Priya] Yeah, hi, sir. My name is Carolina Fernandez. I am calling you from the Microsoft. - [Jim] Oh, hi, Priya. (Priya gasping)Hi. - Who are you?   - [Jim] I'm a ghost.  - [Priya] Do you know my father's name?   - [Jim] I dunno, but is your father proud of you, what you do?   Does he think you work for Microsoft?   - [Priya] Yes, of course. - [Jim] But you don't work for Microsoft. Did you tell him that?   Will I tell you one more name?   - [Priya] Yes. - [Jim] Saweeni. (Priya gasping) Oh my God, Saweeni!Please talk to me. Hello?   - [Mark] He also managed to changethe way their voices sound whenthey would do outbound calls to their potential victims. - [Worker] Who are you?   Who are you?    - [Jim] You're speaking very strangely. What's up?   - So to see a lot more of that quality entertainment, you should go check out his video. So after all that, we're sort of in a good news, bad news situation here. The good news is that because of some developments we'vebeen involved in, the 4th center here is gonna be raided by the authorities in India and shut down very, very soon. The bad news is that these other threeare still very operational. And for reasons I can't say here, we don't have the same option to get them shut down like wedo on the 4th one. Now you might ask, why not just privately reach out to theproper authorities in Kolkata where these three call centers are located?   And the answer is, that's been tried before and it didn't work. While there are many good apples, there are a few bad apples that prevent anything fromhappening to these guys. So where does that leave us?   Well, as they say, sunshine is a great disinfectant.  And here's where you come in. We've invested a lot of resources and time and tried to makethis video as entertaining as possible in the hopes thatyou'll consider sharing it for two reasons. Number one, the more people are aware of how these scams work, the less effective they become and they lose their power. So please share it, especially with your older loved ones.  And number two, the more people that see this video and learn about thesethree specific call centers, the more the press will pick it up, especially in India. Heck, tweet our videos to the Kolkata police. This helps out the good apples because the bad ones can'tjust sweep all the evidence under the rug or quietly tip off the scam center bosses. The press and public can hold them accountable. We've seen this tactic work successfully in the past and wehave mountains of evidence against all these scam centers. If you are with the press or a law enforcement agency, send us an email to callcenterevidencepack@gmail. com and we'll share everything we have with you. If you combine them, these three centers have been inoperation an astounding 29 yearsand they're still scamming people of their life savings tothis day, even right now as we release this video. So let's see what we can do. And depending on exactly what happens,  I'll either post a follow-up video here on my YouTubechannel or on my other social channels. So subscribe and all that stuffif you wanna stay in the loop. Glitter bombs and cockroachesare just harmless entertainment, but our best chance of working together to shut these guysdown for good is by shining a light to foster some accountability.

(dramatic bang)\n","- This is a talking piano, and it's so cool. - Hello!I am a talking piano,  and I'm so cool. - And his name is Chopstix.  (upbeat piano music)So in addition to talking, he can play simple songs like that, but also like, really complicated songs.  (dramatic piano music)So today, not only will we talk about the science behind making a piano speak human, but later, he's gonna play the drums for us and sing for us.  Not yet, Chopstix. Remember, for my videos, that song usually comes a little bit later. - You just assume I watch your videos?    (upbeat piano music) - Anyways. Then he is gonna attemptto play the world's most complicated digital piano songfrom Sheet Music Boss, \"Rush E. \" (chaotic piano music)There's a reason this song has never been played with an actual real-life piano, so I've legitimately got a couple fire extinguisherson hand in case the whole thing goes up in flames.  - Did you say flames?   !I swear, if you so much as make me warm,  my lawyers are going to sue your- - But before we get to any of that, we need to first understand the really cool engineeringbehind how pianos even work. 'Cause if you look at the guts of this modified see-through piano, for something that was inventedby an Italian dude 300 years ago, you can see it's pretty complicated.  In fact, if you zoom in and just isolate on a single key, this is what's happening every time you push downon the white part.  And if you're thinking like an engineer, you know the best design is always the onethat gets the job done in the most simple way possible.  And when I first saw this, no offense to Bartolomeo Cristofori, the inventor of the piano, it just seemed overly complicated.  I mean, the first piano I ever played(bright piano music)was pretty dang simple. Like, why can't you just have a class one leverwhere when I push down here,  there's a fulcrum in the middle, and it hits the string here?   Well, it turns out there's two problemswith that right off the bat. The first is that the hammer remains in contact with the string When you hold the key down. That means the string isn't free to wiggle and vibrate, which is how the sound is created.  Like, with this guitar, (string vibrating)it sounds great until you touch the strings. And now because it can't vibrate, you don't hear anything.  In fact, you can see(metal clacks)that's exactly the problem with this toy piano. The second problem is this is an upright piano,  so the strings must be vertical to fit. But that's an easy enough fixif we shift them here and add an extra hinge point. However, you'll notice we're still damping the string.  And as you can see, (string vibrates)the piano should continue making sound,  even if I'm holding the key down. So how do we do that?   Well, Bartolomeo got real cleverand added a little extra hardware here.  So now when you press the key, this jack flings the hammer forwardso it hits the string, but then the jack gets its foot caught,  which moves it out of the wayso the hammer can move back and not dampen the string. Fun fact:Most people think pianos are considered string instruments,  but this hammer-like actionis why they're actually classified as percussion. (bright piano music) Okay. So now if I press the key down, it will continue to make noise. But wait, if I let my finger go,  the sound should stop. So something is damping that string. But if you look in our current build, you could see if I let the key go,  there's nothing to stop the stringfrom just continuing to vibrate and make sound. To solve this, Bartolomeo added an extra pivot point and some more hardware. So now you see this damper rests on the stringand keeps it quiet until you press the key down.  Then the hammer strikes. Then it's free to vibrateand create noise all the way upto the moment the key is released. And finally, if I wanna play a note really quickly and repeatedly like this, (simple piano music)I need the hammer to be close to the string and not way back here like this. So by adding this backstop, it keeps the hammer close after each hitin case I need to quickly hit it again. So there you have it.  Apologies to my fellow engineer, Bartolomeo. It turns out it's only as complicated as it needs to beand no more.  It's also sort of simplistically beautifulthat all that functionality is from only one input, (string vibrates)every time you press a single key.  Now, Chopstix here is a special case, not only because he's see-through, but because he can play himself.  And it is true pianos that play themselves have been aroundfor over 100 years, but there's an important difference here. An old player piano works by scrolling through a paper sheet like this, and when it encounters a hole, it passes air through, which plays the key. So all the keys are played at full force,  and the timing isn't very precise. Whereas Chopstix here is a modern versionthat uses a solenoid to actuate the key.  We place the solenoids right here, so when the rod extends, it's no different than someone actually pressing the key. You can see them all lined up along here.  But with solenoids, not only do you get your timing downto fractions of a second, but you have 127 different levels of increasing force to press a piano key, which means you can make perfect recreationsof a human player. So here's my friend Andrewfrom the YouTube channel Sheet Music Boss playing a simple sea shanty, and then recording it as a MIDI, and then Chopstix uses that MIDIto play it back perfectly.  Only since he is not limited to a mere 10 human fingers, the songs can get more complicated. (upbeat piano music)   But he can do even better than thatbecause those 88 precision solenoids allow him to make crude reproductions of entire bands. See if he can pick out the singer's actual voicein this classical piece of music history.  (upbeat music)♪ Never gonna give you up ♪♪ Never gonna let you down ♪ ♪ Never gonna run around and ♪♪ Desert you ♪♪ Never gonna make you cry ♪ ♪ Never gonna say goodbye ♪♪ Never gonna tell a lie ♪♪ And hurt you ♪- And so now that we know at least partially what he's capable of, before we attempt \"Rush E, \"let's quickly discuss how we actually make Chopstix speak and sing. Ahem, Chopstix. - Oh, sorry. (gentle thoughtful music)- That's better.  And to do that, I'm gonna pass it over to my buddy Grantfrom the YouTube channel 3Blue1Brownfor a simple explanation.  - [Grant] The signals from speech can be visualizedwith a waveform, which you might think ofas telling you the air pressure next to a microphone as a function of time. If you zoom in on a little window of it, you might notice it looks like a rhythmic repeating pattern.  As it happens, one of the most delightful factsfrom math tells us that for pretty much any signal, you can express it as a sum of pure sine waves,  which in the context of sounds correspond to pure pitches, higher frequency sine waves giving you higher pitches.  If you want to perfectly reconstruct the original signal, this often requires adding a very large numberof pure sine waves, each with a different height.  Now, a favorite tool in signal processingis something called a Fourier transform, which you can think of as telling you the heights of each one of these sine wavesas a function of the frequency you're dealing with. So for our piano project, if you take this Fourier transform and you just consider the peaks, it's a way of giving you the most important notesto be played to recreate the sound.  If you add just a handfulof these dominant frequencies, you'll get a signal which is almost, but not quite, the original signal.  And if we do this processacross many different little windows of our full signal, it's a way of telling us what notes should be playedat what time and with what level of intensity.  And if you do it right, you can get something that sounds like this. - Hey Chopstix! repeat after me! - Hey Chopstix! repeat after me!- Now, I do have to come cleanand admit that I am cheating a little bit by putting the words Chopstixis speaking up on the screen. As humans, 80% of the information our brains gather about our surroundings comes from our sense of sight. And so as our dominant sense, our brain really leans on our eyes,  even when processing what we hear. If you don't believe me, here's two tests you can do right now. Number one, go back and re-watch any part of this video where Chopstix is speaking. Only this time, close your eyes, and see how much harder it is to understand him.  And number two, maybe you've heard this audio clipfrom some random '80s toy saying the word \"green needle. \"- [Toy] Green needle.  - Now compare that to this other clipthat says \"brainstorm. \"- [Toy] Brainstorm. - Only as you might have guessed,  those are the exact same audio clips, which is bonkers because those two words don't even havethe same number of syllables.  For proof, I'll repeat it twice more, only this time you can randomly pick a wordto look at each time. - [Toy] Green needle. Brain storm.  - All right. And so now for the big finale. In a world's first exclusive, I present an actual piano attempting to play the world's hardest piano song, \"Rush E. \"- If anything should happen, promise you'll take care of my bench.  - Of course, buddy. Good luck. (chaotic piano music)  - [Announcer] E. (chaotic piano music)     (chaotic piano music continues)   - That was incredible!(dissonant piano music) - The biggest problem with me making a YouTube videoto try and teach you somethingis that it's just not very interactive, which is why I'm pleased to say my friends at brilliant. org, who just so happen to be supporting this video, have solved this issue.

(birds chirping)\n","- This is a T-shirt cannon. (T-shirt boinging)And this is the cannon that just happens to shoot a T-shirt. (cannon firing) (Mark laughing)(person cheering)That went farther than anticipated. But to understand the convoluted pathfor how I ended up here and eventually right here,  and who the heck this kid is, we've gotta first go back a few months, 'cause that's when I was hanging out with my friend, who had an odd request. Explain what it is you're looking for from me.  - Well my dream is the world's most powerful T-shirt cannon. (Mark laughing)A T-shirt cannon that could possibly kill. - Now to be fair, his request sort of did make sense given he had a college football bowl game named after him, and he didn't wanna disappoint the fans. And I didn't wanna disappoint a friend, so my first thoughtwas to save myself a lot of time on the design by just shooting a T-shirt from an actual cannon. But to do that, I would need to answer one key question. Just how powerful is a real cannon?    And we're about to find out. (smooth music)Six ounces of black powder behind a T-shirtin an actual civil war cannon. Let's see what the heck happens.  This is science. And while we load that in, let's review the simple mechanics of how a cannon works. Basically, the gunpowder goes here, cannonball goes here.  Then you light the gunpowder, and it turns into a gas and expands very quickly. And then the gases are like, dude, it's suddenly way too crowded in this small space for us. We gotta get outta here.  And because all these walls are way too strong, the best option is down the barrel. And since the ball happens to be in the way, it gets pushed along for the ride with all the escaping gas.  They just told me to keep my mouth open. I don't know why. - Fire!- Oh!Yeah!(people laughing) I'm not sure the Jimmy Kimmel Bowlis gonna allow me to fire these into the crowd. I might have to pivot. So obviously an actual cannon was way too powerful.  But to understand by just how much, it was time for the most on-brand measurement device I know. (watermelons thudding)The watermelo-meter.  It's watermelon time. (cannon firing)(smooth music)(cannon whooshing) Nice. So while we enjoyed the fruits of our labors, I was already thinking of a plan B,  and I knew just where to turn. This is Anthony. He was being interviewed by the local news, 'cause he invented a really cool ventilatormade out of Legos.  - Right here, there is area for a oxygen tube. - [Mark] So after he explained how it works, they asked about his future life plans. - I wanna be a mechanical engineer,  and what would be amazingis if I would be able to do a co-op or somethingwith the YouTuber, Mark Rober. - [Newscaster] With who?   - The YouTuber, Mark Rober.  - [Newscaster] Oh. - Oh, he's my favorite YouTube person. Yeah, good luck. - [Mark] Well, clearly only one of these threewas gonna be my future boss, so I tracked him down,  and his parents told him one more local news stationwanted to talk about his build. (electronic beeping)- What's up, Anthony?    I have an engineering challenge that I need some help on. Are you my guy?   - Yeah, sure, yeah. - You know, have you ever seen in a game, they have like T-shirt cannons?    - Yeah. - I thought it would be coolto make the world's largest, most powerful T-shirt cannonfor like a local high school game here. And this was a bit of a white lie.  My real plan was to get Anthony to design it for me. Then he would attendwhat he thought was an ordinary football game. Then I would surprise him by showing up, and telling him it was time to fire his creation in front of 50000 people. But first I needed his ideas. So, we started riffing on how he could design this thing. - Pull it together. - This back section, we can kind of fill.  - And then you have a giant pressure tank back here. It'd be funny if, I don't know, there was like a chariot beside it, that held like a giant air tank in it. - [Mark] So that, maybe in like that,  we could hide it or something, right?   - Yeah. - All right, pal. It was really great to meet you. I'll talk to you soon, okay?   - Okay. - And now that I knew what Anthony had in mind, all we needed was a 10 second build montage to make the thing. (smooth music) Time to load the slug. This is about a three pound ball of rags.  Let's see what happens. This is the first test fire, here we go. And there wasn't a lot of space at this location, so this first shot was about one third full power.  (air hissing)Three, two, one. (cannon firing)(Mark laughing)Oh no, I think we killed the donkey.  (donkey braying)Now it was up to me to go full sandlot, and retrieve this thing. Oh my gosh. (donkey braying)Oh, yeah.  So thankfully, both me and the donkey survived, but it was time to head to a bigger field, so we could really test the full capabilities of the cannon. I dare anyone to get in my way. (light upbeat music) Now I quickly wanna mention, to really appreciate the challenge ahead of us, you have to appreciate that SoFi, where the game was gonna be played,  is just a massive stadium. So the goal of the game was for Jimmy's sidekick, Guillermo, to be in the top row. And then Anthony, Jimmy and I would be down on the field. So this is the correctly scaled shot that we'd have to hit.  And since we know the horizontaland vertical measurements to that seat, we placed a drone in the sky at that exact location. And our goal was basically to hit that drone.  That seems incredibly far away. I've never built anythingthat could remotely shoot that far. Three, two, one, go.  (Mark laughing)And that first shot was at about two thirds full power. And you could see it was well short of the drone, and had a trajectory sort of like this.  It also presented some other issues. Look at that bag, dude. Oh, did we bust?   Oh, we ripped a hole. That's tapeable.  And after that, we decided just to give it all the power she had, and cross our fingers. This is the big mama. 500 PSI, eight pounds.  This is like a real life cannon. Here we go. Three, two, one, go. (cannon firing)(Mark laughing) Yeah, that tape, that tape didn't do so hot. And considering our payload weighed eight pounds, which is basically a gallon of milk, this was a bomb of a shot.  But as you can see from the viewpoint of the top seat, it wasn't far enough. Now I just wanna remind you, this is how far a normal wimpy T-shirt cannonshoots one shirt,  whereas our cannon was shootingthe equivalent weight of 25 shirts at this trajectory, and yet it still wasn't going to cut it. And so we stayed there the whole day, and there were a bunch more tests I won't bore you with,  but the punchline was that no matter what we tried, we couldn't make it to Guillermo in the top row. So I had to call Anthony to give him the bad news, and try and figure out what to do next.  What's up, Anthony?   How's it going, buddy?   - It's been going really good- [Mark] And lucky for me, he'd been hard at work. - Yeah, I'm really busy.  - [Mark] So, we got right into it, and for the first issue of the bag ripping, he suggested we replace our canvas bagwith something stronger. - Kevlar. - [Mark Voiceover] He had another suggestion to protect our bag, though. - Something to produce drag, like a parachute. - And then, he went on to tell mehow he'd anticipated this would be an issue, which is why he'd spent the last two weeksdesigning, building and testing a system that could release a parachuteafter a prescribed time delay. And that's when I realized he would be my bosssooner than I first anticipated. Next, he told me three modifications to make it shoot farther. But before I tell you how he was exactly right, we need to review how the T-shirt canon actually works. So it's the exact same principle as the real canon,  but instead of using gunpowder to make an explosionto make it all super crowded with gas, you take a high pressure tank like this, and put some of that high pressure airinto this accumulator tank.  And then once again, all the gas in that tank is like, it's way too crowded, we gotta get outta here. So when you open this valve, it's a mad dash down the barrel, and the T-shirt just happens to be in the way,  so it goes for the ride just like the cannonball. And this is the same principleas shooting a spitball with a straw. It's the same principle that powered my Nerf gun, my super soaker, and pretty much any system that uses air to launch stuff. So his first suggestion was a bigger tank. And this makes sense, 'cause it would sustain the force on the T-shirtinstead of like with a small tank where you just get a brief poof. And he went on to mention his second idea. - Or like a longer barrel so it can really get up to speed. - [Mark Voiceover] And this is also true, which is why rifles shoot faster bullets than handguns.  And his third suggestion was to increase the sizeof the connecting tube here. So, instead of necking down. - You can just have it go straight to the final diameter.  - And that means there's no traffic jamsas the air rushes out, which means it can get out faster. So after that call, we went back and pretty much institutedall of Anthony's suggestions in some form or another.  And I was feeling like we were back in the game. And so after another full day of testing, this is where we stood. Eight inch cannon, 13 pound mortar with the parachute, 500 PSI,  roll the drone, here we go!Fire!(cannon firing)(Mark laughing) Parachute, yeah!The big bomb. We basically shot nearly two gallons of milk over a 30 story building, and it traveled for two and a half football fields, which put us way beyond the Guillermo spot. Plus, Anthony's parachute system kicked in at just the right moment, so his Kevlar bag landed in pristine shape. And by the way, you might be wondering what's in this massive bag.  Well, the world's largest T-shirt cannonnaturally should shoot the world's largest T-shirt. Probably. I haven't looked it up,  but this has gotta be the world's largest. Look at this thing. So the next step is actually head to SoFi, and show this to the lawyersand see if they'll let us shoot it.  And right off the bat, the lawyers were like, yeah, you're gonna have to usethe smaller barrel and payload, 'cause of like safety or something. I don't know.  The goal is to bomb a T-shirt from right here, literally through the very last seatin the nosebleed section of the stadium. Thanks to Anthony's work, never again will the fine folks in the nosebleed section be robbed of an amazing T-shirt. So we decided to start at one third powerin an attempt to shoot a shot like this, and then we could work our way up.  - [Person Off Camera] In three, two, one!- But that is not what happened. (cannon firing)Oh my gosh. (Mark laughing) Oh my gosh. Anthony, what have you done?   Out of the park, baby. And not being sure if that was a fluke or not,  we tried the same power level again, and this time we dude perfected the crud out of it. Oh, oh, oh!Yeah!With a bank shot off the roof.  The bank shot, baby!And after that, we decided it was prudent to reduce the power furtherto one fourth full pressure, which was killin' me, 'cause if they would've let us open that to full,  based off our previous test, we could have Uncle Rico'd it from this end zoneout the stadium and well into the parking lot. But you know, lawyers.  Let's have it. And so this was our third and final shotat that reduced 25% full pressure. (cannon firing)(smooth music) Oh, yeah!We literally just hit the back of the seatof the very top row in the entire arena.  And that perfectly accomplished our objectivedown to a few inches, which was a huge weight off my shoulders, because I felt like we were locked on Anthony's design.  And I remember my first experiences with engineering, and I really wanted this to be a grand slam for him. And so after a few last minute cosmetic modifications, game day had arrived,  and as the team started warming up, the stands started filling up. Okay, we just received word. Anthony is on the premises, but he's not in his seat yet.  So, it's time for me to go incognito. And to do that, I needed a prop borrowed from my buddy Adam Savage. It's a beard, but it's like glasses.  Friggin' beard glasses. Pretty cool, mm?   Stealin' my cameraman's hat. I look like an ice road trucker. Oh, yeah.  You can't even tell that's me. I'm more nervous I think about the surprisethan I am about actually firing the cannon. (light upbeat music) There they are. They just sat down. All right, let's do this. We're sneakin' up behind Anthony. He's in his seats right now. He has no idea what's goin' on.  This is hands down my favorite part of this job. I love a freaking good surprise. Here we go.  (announcer chattering)Do you like football?   Okay.  What's up, buddy?   You like my beard disguise?   I heard you were here, so I decided to come down and say hi.  - I am shaking. (Mark laughing)- Look, I'm shaking just as much. So, I gotta be honest. You know that cannon we've been designing?    We designed it for this game, and at halftime, you're gonna go out with me and Jimmy Kimmel, and we're gonna fire it in front of 50000 people. And then the teams came back out on the field,  and the game began. And as the quarter progressed, the anticipation was building. - [Interviewer] You got anything else planned for usthat we should know about?    - I do. We built the world's most powerful T-shirt canon. It is an enormous, very, very powerful projectile device, and we're gonna do that at halftime.  - [Mark] And so with halftimejust around the corner, we went to check out his creation. What do you think, buddy?   - That looks amazing. - And I had to explainthat because of his help, we couldn't go more than 25% pull power.  We could crank it all the way up to 550, but that's how you bomb it outta the stadium. - That's how you break a window. - Yeah, that'll break a window. - [Anthony] I'm really excited.  - [Mark] You excited?   Me too. Are you nervous?   - [Anthony] Yeah, definitely. (smooth music)(audience cheering) - All right, buddy. Two minutes left. You ready?   - All right. - Don't think about the 50000 people watching you, okay?    Just don't think about that part. And then it was go time. - Mark Rober, who is a former NASA engineer, they built a very powerful T-shirt cannon.  You want to show it to us, Mark?   - Yeah, yeah, that's right. With my buddy, Anthony. He did all the hard work and designed it. I just built the thing. - You think this is gonna work, Anthony?    - Yeah, I definitely think so, but maybe not. - And there's Anthonyalready qualifying his statements like a true engineer. We do not wanna fire it directly into this section.  - Do not kill anyone, Mark. We are gonna be the first ball gameto put a T-shirt on the moon. - Okay, here we go.  Three, two, it's gonna be loud, cover your ears, one!(audience cheering)- [Jimmy Kimmel] Wow!(Mark laughing)Incredible! - Through the roof. I've been told we've been out of the stadium. We went out of the stadium. - Well, that was very exciting. Thank you, Mark. - Yeah, you're welcome. Good job, buddy. We did it.  What'd you think?   - That was insane. - That was all you, pal. Good job. Thanks, Jimmy. - Thank you. - [Mark Voiceover] And so even after doing our bestto appease the lawyers at one fourth power,  Anthony just noped it right out of the park. So after that we went back and enjoyed the second halfas I just hoped he would remember this experiencefor a really long time, so that I could at least have a leg up one day when I apply to work for his company. (light upbeat music)\n","(glass shatters)- [Mark Rober] This guy stole a package from my car, and a different guy stole my package from a porch, and he's about to open it in his car. - Hello. (glitter bomb pops) (record spins) - But what he doesn't realize isthis is the fourth generationof a new and improved custom-built bait packagethat is recording him on four phonesand just released a pound of the world's finest glitter.  And he's about to discover the other five new surprisesfor this year. Now I know what you're thinking. \"Isn't it a bit excessive to spendthe last four years of your life trying to engineerthe perfect revenge for porch piratesjust 'cause someone stole your package a few years ago and the police wouldn't do anything about it?   \"And to that, I say no. And I'm gonna keep doing it every Christmasuntil we can make a dent in the 2 million packages that are stolen from porches every year. Plus, it's become such a delightful engineering challengefor me to try and think of all the different waysthat we can upgrade it each year. And so with that, this is Glitter Bomb 4.0. (car horn blaring)And that is the first of five major upgrades this year. The lid shoots off as soon as the package thieftries to open it.  Our original design to pull this off was a flywheelthat spun up at irresponsibly dangerous speeds. Then we lowered these wheels to make contactwith the flywheel, and they shared an axle with the gear,  which then used a rack and pinion to launch the lid. But that was just way too over-engineered, even for my lofty over-engineering standards. So that's when we pivoted to a pneumatic system.  But space is limited in the box, so we had to custom design these aluminum pressure intakeswith a little help from my friends at Protolabs. They hooked me up and made six of these in like two days, which was why they're mine and your best friend for quick turnaround machine parts like this. So the tank is filled with air pressurized to 80 psi, and it's nestled here in the base. And then with the top half on, this hall effect sensor right here can sense a magnet attached to the lid. So when the lid is lifted, it triggers the airto rush into the pistons, and the boxing gloves do the rest. And the second major improvement is this car horn,  'cause that just feels like it's gonna make thingsmore exciting for everyone. So when the lid first pops off-(car horn blaring)It actually sounds a little bit more like that.  And the third upgrade is the designof the glitter cup itself. This year, instead of an open cup like thisthat spins all the glitter out in one shot, we have a two-chambered cup like this,  which means we get to fire the glitter three separate times. So the way it works is you pour glitterin the top chamber here, and it fills up both chambers. And when the cup spins, the glitter in the lower chamber flies up and out the sides, but the glitter in the upper chamber is trappeddue to the centrifugal force. Then when the cup stops spinning, gravity basically loads the next batch of glitter in the lower chamber for us. And so now of course it's ready to fly outon the next spin and so on. This totally passive solution meanswe get to save one of our three glitter fires this year for when we get to the endof the out loud countdown sequence. - [Robotic Voice] One. (motor whirring)- [Mark] Now of course you'll still seethe standard four phones here that record the thiefin all directions and upload the footage to the cloud,  as well as these four canistersfilled with 20% more fart sprayof legitimately the worst smell you could possibly imagine, as demonstrated by the timeI almost killed Macaulay Culkin himself.  - (coughs) I can still smell it. (Macaulay chokes)- [Mark] The fourth upgrade is we havea dedicated onboard microphone to record continuous audioonce the package is stolen,  and the fifth is this outer casing is now made fromthis opaque machined acrylic. That means the entire glitter bomb now glows much brighterto light up the scene if it's opened in the dark, and it just looks really dope when the whole box pulses red and blueas we play the fake police scanner chattera few minutes after being opened-(police radio chattering)- To further encourage the thiefto get rid of the box so we can recover it.  And then the final upgrade for this yearisn't actually on the glitter bomb itself. Last year we developed these doormatsthat would covertly charge the box on these contacts so it would be at full battery whenever it got stolen. And that was fantastic, but a lot of boxeswere being taken at night, which was leading to footage that just wasn't that great. So to solve for that this year, we designed these planter boxes,  and when the sun goes down, the side raises up, and they autonomously slide overto swallow up the glitter bomb, concealing it from any would-be thieves in the nightwithout the homeowner needing to hassle with bringing it in and out every day. Then of course in the morning, the process reverses and the box is ready to go. So now when the bad guy comes sneaking by in the dayand steals it off the porch,  the batteries are all at 100% charge, and the box knows it's no longer on the mat, so it starts recording and uploading footage to the cloud, in addition to texting us that it's been stolenand sending GPS location updates.  And so if you compare glitter bomb 1.0 through 4.0, you can really see the design evolution. And while my lawyers have already made it very clearthat I am not allowed to sell this,  if I did, it might look something like this. - [Announcer] Glitter Bomb 4.0is our most advanced glitter bomb ever. Beautiful, complex, yet simple.  A sleek and porch-informed design, now includes a car horn from a Toyota Corollaand 20% more fart spray.  A completely redesigned multi-spray glitter cupwith a pound of our finest biodegradable glittermeans your porch pirate will remember this moment for a very long time, but especially in direct sunlight. Oh, and there is one more thing. Introducing the world's first self-launching lid.  (epic orchestral music)Glitter Bomb 4.0. (epic orchestral music) Because sometimes revenge is a dish best served fabulously.  (epic orchestral music)- So there it is. And while you can't buy Glitter Bomb 4.0,  if you wanna support more efforts like this, you can rock this stylishwire frame Glitter Bomb hoodie here, or we've also got this cool retro pop art version for 4.0 with the boxing gloves, available, of course, only at markrober. com. And so now all that was left to dowas to put it out on porches all across America and wait.  And we didn't have to wait long. (playful music) Wait a sec. Is that who I think it is?   And sure enough, Fort Knuts had run out of walnuts, so instead of trying to make an honest squirrel's living, Fat Gus had apparently turned to a life of crime.  And speaking of which, I'd like to quickly point outthat whether squirrels are stealing your bird seedsso you build them an obstacle course, or humans are stealing your packagesso you go full \"Home Alone, \" the beauty about being an engineeris you can come up with clever solutionsfor your real-life challenges. (bell dings)It's like a superpower, but a superpower you can learn,  and I'd love to see other people catch that spark. Which is why a few times a yearI teach a month-long creative engineering course, and enrollment for the New Year's session is openstarting right now. Over the course of a month,  you're gonna watch me design and createthree builds from scratch. But the best part is I'm gonna guide you through finishingthree creative builds of your own. So whether you're a complete beginneror an experienced engineer,  the class has been designed to meet you wherever you're atand level up your skills. Just go to monthly. com/markrober, or use the link in the video description, then go sign up as a New Year's resolution goal,  and let's hang out making some cool stuff. And now for the sparkly karma. (color bar beeps)(car horn blares)(motor whirring) (cartoon voice laughs)(motor whirring) So he hides it under some clothes, and a few minutes later he brings in a consultant. (beep)- [Thief 1] It's a tracking device!- [Thief 2] Oh, no, no, no, no! - [Thief 1] And it smells like (beep). - [Thief 2] What do we do?   What do we do?    What do we do?    What do we do?   (motor whirring)(color bar beeps)(car horn blares) (motor whirring)- [Gangster] Keep the change, you filthy animal. - [Mark] This guy wins the awardfor our most contemplative thief ever.  (motor whirring)I've sped this footage up to double time.  So we help to make up his mindwith a third round of glitter, fart spray, and then the countdown.  (motor whirring)(motor whirring)- [Robotic Voice] 15, 14-(color bar beeps)- [Mark] And as if stealing a glitter bomb wasn't a bad enough choice already, this guy doubles down and decides to open it in his car. (motor whirring) (cartoon voice laughs)- [Thief] (beep). (beep), man.  (motor whirring)(car horn blares)(motor whirring) (motor whirring)- [Robotic Voice] Fifteen, fourteen. Three, two, one. (package clatters)- [Mark] And it's worth mentioning, of course,  we have to make multiple glitter bombs, because sometimes they do take a beating. (color bar beeps) (cartoon voice laughs)And yet they battle through the pain like champs.  (motor whirring)(color bar beeps)- [Thief 1] Look what I found!- [Thief 2] Did they see you take it?   - [Thief 1] Nobody saw me. - [Thief 2] Like Harry and Marv.  - [Mark] And they're referring to our dead giveawayshipping label here, with Harry and Marv on Wet Bandit Way. - [Thief 1] I feel bad, but I really wanna open it. (laughs) - [Thief 2] I say you flip a coin. Heads you keep it. - [Mark] And apparently they landed heads, 'cause a few hours later, this happened. (car horn blares) (motor whirring)(cartoon voice laughs)- [Thief 1] What the (beep)?    (motor whirring)(color bar beeps)- [Mark] This guy stole it and took itstraight to a pawn shop to try and negotiate a deal.  - [Thief] 500.- [Pawnbroker] No, I told you 400.- [Thief] No, give me one more hundred and we're good. - No. - One more hundred. This thing is brand new, (beep). Come on. - [Pawnbroker] The wrapping looks kind of weird. - [Thief] No, they're 2021. - [Pawnbroker] Let me open it and see ifit's just in there first. - [Thief] One more hundred, (beep). One more hundred. - Can I open it?   - [Thief] Yeah, go ahead. (car horn blares)- What the (beep)?   (motor whirring) (cartoon voice laughs)- [Mark] And this one's hilarious to me, 'cause if he wouldn't have got greedy, he could have walked out of there with 400 bucks. - [Woman] It's a bomb.  Yeah, yeah. Put it outside!(motor whirring)- [Robotic Voice] Fifteen, fourteen-- [Mark] And instead, he gets zero dollars and a bedazzled jacket. - [Robotic Voice] Detonation imminent. (color bar beeps)- [Thief 1] Oh my God, look it. (car horn blaring) (motor whirring)(cartoon voice laughs)- [Thief 2] Maybe they put a thing on there so it went off. - [Thief 1] Did you see and hear that?   (motor whirring)- [Thief 2] Put it back down. - [Thief 1] Really?   - [Thief 2] Each time, more (beep) comes out.  - [Thief 1] It stinks too. - [Thief 2] Oh (beep), babe. Look at how full it is. (motor whirring) (motor whirring)(color bar beeps)(car horn blares)(motor whirring) (cartoon voice laughs)- Oh. (laughs)It's a trick. Someone fooled you.  (motor whirring)- Oh!Ugh, it stinks!- Move.  - [Woman] Go throw it away. - Oh, (beep). Smells like (beep). No! (motor whirring)(motor whirring)- [Mark] They eventually threw it away, and then went the extra mile to help us rinse offall the glitter. (speaker screeches) Followed up with a light dusting. (broom thuds)(broom thuds)(color bar beeps)Last year, if you might recall, we went up to San Francisco,  a. k. a. the car break-in capital of the world, and got a glitter bomb taken in a matter of minutes. And while we never got them to actually open the box, it did have an interesting conclusion.  - [Thief] I could bang it. I could bang-(alarm blaring)(static crackles) (color bar beeps)- [Mark] So this year, naturally, we went back, and at the end of day one, we had no takers. But then we stopped for like two minutes to get some snacks for the trip home, and when we came back to the car, we saw this. They took the backpack with the GoProsbut left the freaking glitter bomb. So now it was definitely on.  So we went back to that exact spot the next day, and within 10 minutes, this happened. (window shatters) (window shatters)And you could see here just how quickly they work. - [Thief 1] Put that in the back, bro. - [Mark] You can literally hear them doinganother smash and grab here,  not four minutes after they smashed our window. - [Thief 1] Come on, come on, come on, come on!(beep), hurry up!Let's go! - Yo, my car!Yo, what the (beep)?   ! Yo, (beep)!- [Mark] And unfortunately, in all the jostlingof stolen goods, the glitter bomb had a false trigger-(car horn blares)(motor whirring) - [Thief 1] What was that?   - [Mark] And they were onto us. - [Thief 2] That (beep) has a light, (beep)!- [Thief 1] What you talking about, boss?   - [Thief 2] Look, (beep). Yo, what the (beep) is that?   Throw that out, baby. - [Thief 1] Hell nah.  - So if we're keeping track at home, that's car thieves with three points and me with zero, without a single ounce of glitter being fired. Now I'm not proud of that,  but there is a silver lining here, because the police rolled up on us after this break-in, and let's just say they are both familiar with, and fans of, the work being done here.  In fact, they were actually tracking the guysthat smashed our window, but then they lost them. So next year I'll be joining forces with themin some capacity, and I'm given a Mark Rober guarantee that I'm gonna get some points on the board, and perhaps uncover how these guys run their whole operationin the process. So make sure you're subscribed if you don't wanna miss that. But it wasn't just the police who'd heard about the glitter bomb this year. Just like before, we also put some glitter bombsby a few group mailboxes, and I'm happy to report the overwhelming majority of peopledo the right thing and either don't take it or even go out of their way like this nice lady. In fact, they were stolen approximately half as oftenas last year, so either people are getting more honest, or perhaps, I don't know,  enough people have seen these videosthat it's the devastating power of glitterthat's encouraging more civil behavior. And I'll just leave you with two pieces of evidencethat kind of seem to support this working theory.  (color bar beeps)- [Thief 1] I was lucky. That's a lucky steal right there, man. Best that money can buy. (car horn blares) - [Thief 2] Oh, (beep). (motor whirring)Oh, you son of a (beep). - [Thief 1] Oh, it's one of those gifts?   - [Thief 2] Oh, wow. I seen that on TV, man.  - [Thief 1] What's it do?   - [Thief 2] Put that top back on. - [Thief 1] Why?   (motor whirring)- [Thief 2] The glitter that he showed on TVwas that sticky kind.  That's what you get for taking people's stufffrom in front of their house. God, right in my house. (beep)That thing has a tracer on it too.  The cops are gonna be right outside. (color bar beeps)- [Thief] Then I'm wondering if it's oneof those (beep) package thief thingsthat spay out fart glitter. If this thing is gonna start talking and five, four, three, two, one. (car horn blares) Oh my god!It is!(motor whirring)- [Mark] So just don't steal packages, 'cause it's not nice.  But if you do need some extra incentive, just know you might be opening next year's glitter bomb. - [Thief] It is one of those glitter bombs. And it has fart smell and everything.  - [Mark] And trust me, you don't wanna meet version 5.0.(motor whirring)(tense music)\n","- This is what it looks liketo close out a year of your lifetrying to answer one of life's most basic questions. Exactly how high can elephant toothpasteactually be launched into space?   Now, if this looks sort of familiar,  it's because this isn't my first attempt. Last year, my buddy Fletcher and Iwere here with this monster of a flaskbut with one critical oversight. We didn't make the floor stiff enough because I just didn't consider the forces to be so highthey'd lift a one ton structure five feet into the air, and so, while that attemptdid yield a new Guinness World record of 60 feet, I couldn't stop thinking about just how high it could have gone if only all that stuffthat came out of the bottom was actually forcedto come out through the top. Like, what would happen if I spent the yeardesigning and building something that weighed five tons and was basically bombproof?   And then what if we could just go onto make the world's most epic surprise partyby building a massive slip and slide skateboard ramp,  along with the 26 million Orbeez pool, plus a devil's toothpaste explosiontwo and a half times bigger than previously. Then, the only thing that would be missingwould be someone to throw the surprise party for,  and that's where my new friend Brody comes in. Now, to understand who Brody is, all you really need to knowis that as him and his family were going throughan incredibly difficult time in their lives as he narrowly fought through his battleagainst blood cancer for three years, Brody used his one and only Make-A-Wish chanceto buy a brand new ATV for another kid with cancer He didn't even knowwhen he heard that kid had his ATV stolen. By the way, I told my friend, Mr. Beast, this story, and he had some thoughtson what we should do about this situation. So now that we had a plan for the surprise party and a kid who definitelydeserved the world's most epic surprise party, it was time to return to my buddy Dale's walnut farmin the small town of Gridley, California and get to work.  And while I'd love to take creditfor single-handedly digging out in the entire Orbeez pitthe truth was as word got out about Brody's story, the good people of Gridley came out to help in droves.  So Arnie here, who's been operating a backhoe for 60 yearsvolunteered to dig the Orbeez pool, while Dave, the town master carpenter, started working on the skateboard ramp. I even harnessed some child labor to prep the devil's toothpaste troughs. Although, it sort of backfiredwhen they began to protest against theirharsh working conditions. Which just left my nemesis, the giant elephants toothpaste flask.  And this time, I was taking no chances. And so for the base, we laid a concrete padwhich would be attached to the flaskwith 33 quarter inch boltswith a total clamping force of 80 tons.  And then instead of a structure made of two by foursthe plan was to use five tonsof steel all fused together by the town welder, Jeff. On top of that, we designed the flask to be 20% bigger.  So now all we needed was a 20 secondbuild montage to get it all done. (upbeat music)  And so as the party construction continued onfor several days in the 105 degree heat, let me take a moment to try anddebunk a myth about elephant toothpaste floating around on the internet. There are some wildly popular videos on YouTube, some with over 30 million viewsand hundreds of thousands of likeswhich demonstrate that when you simply add a bunch of soda to some Orbeez and then create a mento Sprite solutionand pour it over the top, you get this, which is pretty impressive. - Look at that. - This also works with Mentos.  Why didn't Mark Rober tell us that?   - Maybe he didn't want us to break his record?   - True. - Now I had a slightly different hypothesiswhich was that these guys were faking the scienceand lying to people for YouTube views.  So as firm believers in the scientific method, Science Bob and I tested that hypothesis. And as it turns out, if you follow their exact methodology, then combine the mixtures and run real fast,  exactly nothing happens. And even if you don't trust our demonstrationwell then you're gonna have to explain howthe balloon shadow somehow stops right hereat the edge of the hole.  And where these orange globs are splashing up from, and how the hole itself completely changes shapefrom this frame to this oneonce they've removed their layer mask.  The way they actually did that is the same wayelephant toothpaste is always made. And that's to mix the correct amounts of hydrogen peroxidesoap and food coloring. Then you just add a catalyst like potassium iodide.  And in preparation for this year's partywe also played around withthe devil's toothpaste formula we discovered last yearwith, at times,  very interesting results. Now, as a reminder, this is normal elephant's toothpaste, and this is devil's toothpaste.  It reacts insanely fast, and I don't give out the formulabecause it's super dangerous, even if you are, for examplewearing some very nice protective gloves. And so back in Gridley with Brody's arrival slated for the next morning, the afternoon turned into the eveningas the feverish pace of workcontinued late for the third night in a row. If this dang mega flash somehow bested me again at least I could console myself in the factthat it wouldn't be from lack of effort. And so when morning came with only a few last minute bitsof preparation left to go, I headed to a doctor's officeabout an hour and a half away where Brody thought he flew out to see some more specialistsfor a day filled with medical tests. - Okay, we ready?   - Okay. Okay. Thank you.  - Fletcher and his incredible hair also came backout to help with the surprise. And I just wanna preemptively sayI know I'm quite possibly the world's suckiest actor.  - Well. I'm Dr. Fletcher. We got a lot of stuffto look at, testsum, 'cause today, this actually isn't a doctor appointment at all.  - And while I think I'm being all tricky here, he later said he figured out it was meas soon as he heard my terrible doctor accent. - What up buddy?   I actually brought someone to help us out today too.  This is Fletcher. Fletcher here, He was with us last year. We did a big party. So today we're gonna do another party and it's gonna be fun.  You brought someone with you?   - Gavin. - Gavin. Let's go meet Gavin. How's it going buddy?   - I followed you when I was like six. I've known you for so long. I love your videos.  Oh, this is, oh, thank you. This is Fletcher. - Hi, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - And that's Ila, Fletcher's sister. All right, let's bounce. Here we go. So step one is to get in the Tesla.  - So, we actually have, and I'll leave this up to you guys. We have two ways to get to Gridley.  Option one is to take the Tesla. Does anyone want to prematurely just say theywant option one?   Or do you want to hear option two?   - I wanna hear option two. - You sure?    It's a Tesla! Okay. Option two. And again, you guys get a vote on this. Private jet. - Option two.  - Option two. - Have you guys ever ridden on a private jet?   - No!- Let's ride on a private jet. - Your guys' private jet is ready. - Private jet's ready! Remember guys, act like we've done this before. And the private jet was definitely out of my budget, but a generous benefactor caught windof what we were doing and let us use his which actually helped because it cut the oneand a half hour drive down to just 12 short minutes. - So guys, we just landed. - I knew it. - I knew it.  - I knew it was a limo. - Only the finest. - We live in luxury!- And so after a short trip in a sweet ride, Brody had arrived. (group cheering) (upbeat music)     - So now that the party was rollingand we were feeling refreshed,  it was time to head over to see some explosive chemistryin the form of six massive devil's toothpaste troughs. Now I need to pause here to make two points. The first is that because each trough holds two and a half times more volume than the barrels last year, we couldn't just dump it on the topbecause it reacts so fast, the catalyst wouldn'teven make it to the bottom before it was launched out. So each trough that contained the mixture of the hydrogen peroxide, soap, and food coloringbasically has a massive syringe attached to the sidethat contains the catalyst. Then we put a big fat pressurized air tank here. So when you open this butterfly valve, the air would rush into this chamber, thereby sliding the pistonover and causing everything to mix really well. And as you can see in real life, this happens pretty fast.  And the second is you might notice it looks like oneof the troughs already kind of went off. And the truth is, when I walked up, things looked like this. We tested for so many different things to prepare for this but one thing we didn't think to test was if thefood coloring manufacturer added some new ingredientonly to the purple color. So now it randomly reacts with hydrogen peroxide all on its own. So after a bit of leaf blowing, we were ready to powerthrough even if we did lose twoof our six troughs to that little mishap. - Here we go. Here we go. Here we go.  - 3, 2, 1.(exclamations and cheers)      - Let's check it out. Yes. Oh my goodness.  Oh, you can feel the heat. - Oh, it's hot. - Fletcher, we have a camera. Go get the cameras. - Where are they?   - Right in the middle. - All right, I got it. - What'd you guys think?   - That was crazy!- And so while I helped clean up like a bonafide ghostbuster we had to get all hands on deckto prepare for the grand finale mega flask. Like last year, the idea was to start the reactionby having these troughs dump the catalystinto the hydrogen peroxide pool below.  So chemicals had to be loaded in super carefullybecause even if a small amountsplashed out prematurely, we'd havean even more disastrous situationon our hands than with the purple food coloring.  But Brody still had no idea that was coming. So we distracted him with a different surprise firstin the form of some quality time in 26 million Orbeez (upbeat music)     - Submersing yourself in millionsof Orbeez is such a wild feelingbecause it's like having a squishyslippery weighted blanket compressing all around you no matter where you move. And while we could have stayed therefor a few more hours, soon enough, we got the messagethat the flask was in its final preparations. So we all headed back over. And word apparently had spread at this point.  So quite a crowded gathered, including the mayor of Gridley. So the pressure was really on for me to finally avengethat L from last year and to get Brody a dang world record.  - Look at this. - And so with that all that was left nowwas to place all our hopes and dreamson our engineering abilities and dump the troughs.  - 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.(screaming and cheering)     - We actually had a pressure sensor in the flask and it turns out the forcepushing all the elephant toothpasteout the top is about 50 times the force youfeel when pushing against a fully inflated football.   - Oh my God, yes.  - That was so cool. The mannequin. The mannequin is still there. - Wow. Oh, look at that.  It's like a volcano. Whoa. See, it's still like barfing out the top. - Oh my gosh. - Is that better than going to the doctor's office?   Look how far over it went.  Wow. The flask stayed together. You got me once, elephant's toothpaste. You don't get me twice.  - And in fact, when you do a side-by-side comparisonof the max height from last year to this year, I'm happy to report we absolutely destroyedthe previous record by nearly a factor of five,  rising to the height of a 25 story building at 250 feet. And so with the new Guinness World record under his beltI still had one grand final surprise for Brody.  So back at the house while science Bob distracted the crowdwith liquid nitrogen powered exploding watermelonsand trash can rockets nearly taking out our drone pilot Nerc in the process. I called up a friend of mine. - What up buddy?   - Hi, what up MrBeast?    This is my friend Brody.  We've been hanging out all day today. - How's it going?   Did he do the Orbeez thing?   He told me he got 25 million Orbeez. - Yeah.  - Yeah. Is that more Orbeez than you did?   - No. - We had a pool though. I think MrBeast has one more surprise. - Do me a favor and turn around real quick. - Oh my God, that's your hog right there.  Delivered by none other then Dale himself. Well get on buddy. It's not mine, it's yours.  - And what's cool here is this is the exact modelhe wanted to get for himselfbefore he gave it away to someone else. And he didn't do that expecting to get something back in return, just like those who worked so hardto put this party together for himdidn't expect anything either. Which is why I believe when you try to be a good person it may not always come back to you immediately, but somehow it always comes back. \n","- This is Dom. He's a friendly little robot that's super goodat only one thing, setting up a butt ton of dominoesreally, really fast. It's taken five years to get to this point,  but according to our initial test, we have hopesthat he might be more than 10 times fasterthan the fastest human. So today we're gonna put him to the test,  going head to headagainst the world's foremost domino expert, who unfortunately is a mere human. Then we're gonna attempt a Guinness World Recordand he's gonna try and fill this entire warehouse with a mural of a 100000 dominoes. And for context, setting up a domino mural that sizewould take a team of seven skill builders one full week.  Dom here is gonna attempt to do it by himself in 24 hours. Now I know what you're thinking, \"Big whoop, Mark, \" because as a kid you might have had a toy that looked like thisor even this custom robot KiwiCo made methat can drop 20 dominoes in a row. So isn't it a bit overkill to utilize an autonomous robot a half mile of Hot wheels tracks, and a high speed robotic arm?   And I get it because our designs look like this, where we're just trying to hack a little Roomba when we first tried to tackle this problemexactly five years ago. But then pesky details with scale arise. Like for starters,  just how much a hundred thousand dominoes is. So the robot will need to comeand reload at least a thousand times. But how exactly do you reload it?    And how would it know exactly where to drop each dominoand what color it should be?   And how do you make it so reliable that it doesn't screw up once in a hundred thousand drops of a domino?   A system to reliably tackle issues at scales like thisis just going to be inherently super complex.  Like 10 times more complexthan my automatic bullseye dart board, which to this point was probably the most complicated buildon my channel. So after failing off and on for three years,  I was doing a Q and A at Maker Faire, and I told the crowd if anyone wanted to help mewith the brutal challenge to hit me up afterwards. And to my absolute delight, two freshmen from Stanford and a software engineer from the Bay Areaall took me up on the challenge. So I hired them and two years later, here we were.  Now, before I show you how it all works, I first wanted to put him in a head-to-head competitionto see how good he really was. And for that, we need the undisputed heavyweight champion on YouTube for all things dominoes, Lily Hevesh. Lily, you are known on YouTubeas the Queen of Dominoes, right?    - People do call me the Domino Queen. - And for very good reason, with over 1.2 billion viewson her channel, you've almost certainly seen oneof her incredible creations over her 12 years on the platform. She's so good she's even got her own lineof dominoes you can buy in stores. Okay, so here's the challenge, Lily, I want you to set up like 300 dominoes right now and let's see how long it takes a human to do that. - Okay. - Okay?   Clock starts now.  - I gotta do two hands. - If you need me, Lily, I'm just sitting here reading my newspaper.  For you kids at home, a newspaper is like a boring iPad made from trees. (upbeat music)(laughing) That's actually pretty fast.  - Oh no!- Oh a disaster!The foibles of being a human! Okay, Lily, are you ready for this?   - No! - I've seen enough. (blowing air through fingers)I actually dunno how to whistle. This is The Dominator! - Oh my God, wow!I love the eyes.  - A good set of googly eyes will go a long ways. Okay, boy, let them down. I suck at dominoes Lily, but I'm good at engineering.  Which means I'm actually really good at dominoes. We even showed off!The Dominator double stacked the middle row for you.  - That is impressive!That is seriously impressive. - This technique of laying down a tile of 300 dominoes at once was really the key that helped us crack the scaleand reliability issues. And it's probably my favorite part about The Dominatorbesides his wiggly tail, of course.  Here's Josh to explain more. - So we have these 3D printed funnels herewhich allow us to drop all 300 dominoes all at once. - And the mechanism that drops those into the topof this tray, we'll show that in just a second.  - And if we remove these funnels here, we can see that the dominoes are precisely placedin their locations. This allows us to place 300 dominoes exactly where we want them all at once. - And they don't fall out because of what we callthe Connect Four mechanism under here. But if we trigger the servo, then it slides that Connect Four tray over and drops them all at once, making for some gratuitous, beautiful slow-mo shots. (upbeat music)  And so while this looks really cool, obviously dropping from that height wouldn't be effective. So we lower the whole platform down on this ball screw then set them right on the floor, which turned out to be incredibly reliable. So Dom took the W in round one, but now it's time for the endurance round.  Okay, first one to 10000, dominoes wins. Lily, you ready?    - I'm ready. - Dominator, you ready?    Start! (upbeat music)- Oh my God. Wow, I already failed.  - That's great. (upbeat music) And to Lily's credit, she was actually insanely fast. Just not, you know, robot fast. - So unfair.  So unfair!- On top of that, she had to handle a very large distractionwith the emotional maturity of a nine-year-old. Yep, I think I'm doing pretty good.  (upbeat music)You're doing very good for human, I'll give you that.  Oh, no!(laughing)(upbeat music) No what?   No what, Lily?    - Get out of here. Nope, get out, get out!(Mark yelling)- That feels so much faster than it probably looks.  How's Lily doing?   - Tired!- [Mark] And so while Lily's outputslowed down considerably, Dom's did not. And I should mention we sometimes call him Dom,  but that's just short for his legal birth name, which as noted before is Dominator. 'Cause you know, like domino, dominator.  Whatever, it all works. - I'm gonna head to the bathroom. - Oh, Lily has to go to the bathroom. - I'm human, right?    Dominator, do you have to go to the bathroom?   Didn't think so. 9, 000 perfectly laid dominoes in a little over two hours, actually, 9, 001.We got a bonus domino out there in the middle of this field.  May or may not have been on purposebut now we can say it's actually over 9, 000.It was a pretty clear result. And Lilly, of course, was gracious in her defeat to the machine overlords. So all that was left to do now was to knock them down. (dominoes clinking) Yes, that was satisfying!So we went head to headwith the world's foremost domino expert and came out on top. And now it's time for the real challenge to attempt a Guinness World Recordand see how quickly we could fill this entire roomwith a mural of over a 100000 dominoes. All right, buddy, you got the game plan now you just gotta get out there and execute. Godspeed, little fella, godspeed. (whimsical music) 300 dominoes down a hundred, 102000 left to go.  ♪ Enchante ♪ (upbeat music)  - So we're about six hours in, but more importantly,  we just got our first Goomba. This is beautiful!Back to work Dom.  And the best part about working really hard for a few yearsis that the last 24 hours are super relaxing. (upbeat music) And with that tile placed we are officially halfway donewith over 50000 dominoes put down in just a little bit over 12 hours. And Dom, whoa, easy boy, just showing no signs of slowing down. So this is a good point to explain the rest of the robotic system. It all starts over here with the loading stationthat Josh and John-Luke spend a lot of time optimizing. The dominoes are loaded by color on these conveyor belts and then a KUKA robot arm grabs themand places them in one of 300 loading shoots madefrom 2. 7 miles worth of hot wheel tracks.  And you could load Dom directly with the robot armbut this is much faster because he doesn't have to wait. He just comes in here to the docking stationand the lower platform slides over so the bottom layer of 300 dominoes gets loaded up all at once. And we also had a backup loading system using a tray justin case at any point the robot arm wasn't working.  Besides the Hot Wheels tracks, there's a ton of 3D printed parts throughout the buildthat we either printed ourselves or if we were in a pinch, my friends at MatterHackers helped us out.  So that's the loader. Now how about The Dominator himself?   How does Dom know exactly where to goin the room to drop a domino?   - So we've pre-programmed the route for all 102000 dominoes so the robot knows exactly where to go right from the start. Then as we're driving around, we use these indoor GPS sensors to track the position of the robot so it knows roughly where it is. And then as we get closer to the placethe dominoes need to drop, we use these IR cameras that are tracking markerson the ground to make sure the robot lines up perfectly every single time. - So the vision from the beginning isthat we could set Dom up, we could turn off the lightsand leave and come back the next morning, and you've got like a full field of dominoes set up.  - He could work all night in the dark, just fine. - All right, now how about these super cool wheels?   - So these are called omni wheels and they're awesomebecause they let you translate it any direction you want.  So this is way better than like your car, where if you need to move a little bit to the left or rightyou have to make like a five point turn. So with these guys, you can move any direction you want to adjust for small corrections in the placementof the dominoes. These wheels are powered by these ClearPath brushlessDC servo motors. These are like the gold standardin terms of speed and accuracy,  and they allow us to slide the robot aroundby even just a couple millimeters at a time, which is super useful when we're trying to makereal fine adjustments for placing the dominoes down. - Now obviously that's just the uppermost tip of the iceberg tip, but Dom's brain is over 14000 linesof code all from scratch. So if you wanna go way deeper into the technical details I'll put a link in the video descriptionwhere Alex put it all in one spot. Now back to finishing the second half. (upbeat music) ♪ Enchante ♪ (upbeat music)   So The Dominator has been running just under 24 hoursand this is a bit of a momentous tile here.  It's-a me, Mario!(upbeat music) 102, 300 dominoes are on the floor successfully. This is the last 300. I think this is a moment, you guys get back over here. Josh and Alex, let's observe it.  Don't blow this Dom. You got it buddy, finish strong. (dominoes clinking) We got it!Just over 24 hours to lay all the dominoes, gentlemen.  So now with everything set upthe final critical step was to knock them down. You can see John loading in the Mario pipes because they were gonna be our trigger mechanism. The way that works is we've got four Hot Wheel cars gluedto the bottom of this platformthat rides in these parallel Hot Wheels tracks.  Then you slap a green sliding shell on topand a motor at the end pulls the cart along the trackswith a string. Then the shell contacts the lever arm at each pipe like this, which causes them to roll forward, down the ramp, hopefully into the dominoes. Okay, now I'm nervous.  I wasn't nervous. Now I'm nervous. Okay, 3, 2, 1, go. (motor whirring) (dominoes clinking) Yes, yes!Three! (dominoes clinking) Four! (dominoes clinking)Five! (dominoes clinking) - Oh my gosh! (dominoes clinking)(Dom beeping happily) (dominoes clinking) (build team cheering) - Yes! - Awesome!- Holy cow! - Whoa.  - Oh my gosh!And in the end, Dom was 50 times fasterthan a skilled domino builder, and he got himself a world record to show for it.  Although, to be fair to us organisms, it was in the non-human category. And at that point, after five yearswe were just so relieved to be done. We got a little carried away celebrating the champ with an appropriate sendoff. (upbeat music) What do we do now?   - Build a robot to clean it up. - Ah, there we go!A cleanup robot.  \n","- This is me in a flimsy cage, in the middle of the ocean at night, surrounded by hungry sharks. We were there experimenting with somemesmerizing bioluminescence we capturedin this jar, which was really cool. But unfortunately for us, the sharks agreed.  So once again, I found myselfin a precarious situation risking my life for science. And for that, I blame my friends at Discovery, because for Shark Week this yearthey sent me to the fricking Bermuda Triangle. Now, in the past to celebrate Shark Week, I've ran experiments to answer important questions such as,  can sharks really smell a dropof blood in the water from a mile away?   Or given the choice, do they have a preferencefor human blood over fish blood?   And so this year I'm headed backwith some contraptions I builtto potentially debunk a few more shark myths.  And our experiments are gonna get usdangerously close to sharks in the shallows, and then so deep, it's like we're visiting an alien planet. And we're even gonna take a critical look intowhether the Bermuda triangle itself is actually cursed.  There's a legend on this here island. (everyone screams)- But of course to do that, I'll need an expertin the paranormal, AKA, Noah fricking Schnappfrom Stranger Things. - This is spookier than the Upside Down. - And so before I head to the Bermuda Triangle in an eight second travel montage to meet Noahfor the first time, in an effort to make him feelmore comfortable, I'm gonna harness my inner Hopper. (upbeat music) To kick things off, I reunited withmy marine biologist shark expert buddy, Luke Tipple. - Luke. - Good day, mate. How you doing?   - What up, buddy?   We learned a lot last year, I feel like. What attracts sharks?    What kind of noises I make when my life's in grave danger?   (Mark screams)And then as soon as Noah showed up, we decided we wanna get him right outto see his first ever shark in real life, and to test our first potential myth, which has to do with sharks attacking people with GoPros.  (upbeat music)Come here. Come here. - No.  (Mark laughs)- Oh my God. There's no way we're swimming with that. (Mark continues laughing)- No way. - Bonkers, right?    - Oh my God. - [Mark] Look, down here. Look at this. - Oh my God. No, no, no, there's no way. Are we going in with those?    - We're going in with those.  - Oh my God. (water gurgles) (Noah yells and Mark laughs)- No, I'm going home. - And so while Noah reconsidered his life choices, we came up with a game plan. All right, Luke, last time we were out here, we have these like 360 cams on a stick,  and the sharks went for it. Like a number of times, they would bite at it, right?   And I've actually heard that sometimes you goon a dive, like in Hawaii, they'll actuallytell you you cannot bring a GoPro, because they say the sharks are attracted to, like, the electromagnetic waves and it feels like, eh.  Is that true?    - I thinkthere's something to it. - According to Luke, he's definitely seen sharkssnap at GoPros on a selfie stick. But it was unclear if that's just 'causeyou're shoving the stick way out in front of their face, or is there's actually some kind of electromagnetic waves from the GoPro that got them excited. And that's sort of an important distinctionif you own a GoPro. We prove that they love the electric fields, maybe don't attach one to your head. So, we came up with an experiment to test this. We would dive down and Luke would be holding a selfie stickwith the GoPro actively filming inside.  And then as a control, I would beright next to him with an identical selfie stickwith an identical GoPro housing, but it would be empty. So the only difference between these two would bethe tiny electrical field coming from the filming GoPro.  And then at that point we just count how many timeseach of our selfie sticks got bumped or attacked. And while I was obviously a little skeptical, there is some validity to the theory here. Part of the reason sharks have existed as apex predatorsfor 450 million years is because they detect and hunt their dinner, not only with the same five senseswe do, but with two bonus senses as well. Their sixth sense is to detect even slight pressure changesin the water in all directions around them at all times. And then their seventh is their ability to detect electric fields. That's what all these little dots under here are for. And this matters because when any muscle contracts, it gives off an electrical signal. That's how the brain controls them. So sharks can sense a fish using its musclesto try and swim away or even a completely stationary fish simply because of its beating heart. And so with the testing plan in place, it was time to gear up and enjoy Noah'sfirst ocean scuba dive experiencewith a warm welcome from 25 swarming sharks. - [Noah] Oh my God, there's so many.  - [Luke] We have about 20 Caribbean reef sharks here, and Noah's looking pretty freaked out. - [Noah] This is unreal. - [Mark] So we set up camp on the bottomand started the experiment.  And it seemed at first they were kind ofscoping us out for a bit, after whichthey got a little bit more confident. - [Luke] Okay, we got one hit on the camera. There's a second hit on the camera.  - [Mark] I got a hit. - [Luke] Well, I've definitely had two, but no bites. - [Mark] So after about 10 minutes, while there were a few close calls-Oh gosh, oh gosh, right by my face. And certainly some interest in our selfie sticks, there were definitely no attacks yet.  So, we headed back up to tally and compare our results. Yeah, that's the scariest part, right?   They swim, like, right at your face. - Yeah, like they're coming like this. I don't know - Yeah, and atthe last moment. - if I should move or-- they, like, try to see how scared we are. - They swim right past me and they're like eyeing me. And I'm like, do I keep- - (laughs) Me, too. - Do I, like, look away, like- - (laughs) Yeah, don't look them in the eye. When we looked at the footage, Luke's running GoPro got bumped five times, while my empty camera case was only bumped once, which was interesting, but I wouldn't exactlycall that a clear cut result to the rumorthat sharks will attack GoPros because they mistake the electric fields for prey. But lucky for us, I had a backup planto get more conclusive evidence. I think to really level it up, I've got something over here I wanna show you guys. Dun, duh, duh, dun, (everyone laughs) duh, duh, dun. - Woo. - Padabow, padow, padow, pow! - How many GoPros is that?   - I'm glad you asked, Luke. 21!Okay, so we're, this is a twofer. First of all, we've got a bunch of GoPros, so if they're interested in one, we'll take it to an extreme,  and they should really go crazy for this, right?   - Yeah, if they don't like this one, then they don't like GoPros. - Exactly. But the second purpose for this rigis because the 21 cameras are equally spaced apart, this is a waterproof version of that fancybullet time rig made famous by the Matrix. Now, two years ago I came up with a poor man's version of this by sticking a 360 camera to the end of a harpoon, and that worked pretty well as you could see here. But we tested this new and improved rigat the pool that morning, and I was even more hopefulfor this version, because we were able toget some super dope shots like this one.  Now, Caribbean reef sharks are pack hunters, and this is why some argue they'rethe most dangerous sharks in the Bermuda Triangle, because they get each other worked up in a frenzy. And so my hope was, the sharks would in factget really worked up by all the GoPros to the point that it was a frenzy. Because I'm pretty sure that's just somethingNoah would want to experienceunderwater, you know, - Oh!- up close and personal. So, now that his mind was mentally preparedfor what might lie ahead, it was timeto get back in the water for the follow-up test.  I gotta pee, and luckily two years agowe proved that sharks aren't attracted to urine, so, I'll be fixing that situation in about five minuteswhen we're in the water. (Mark splashes loudly)- Yeah, the rig! And so while we conducted our super-sizedfollow-up experiment, we took the opportunityto capture some bullet time shots as well. In the end, they just weren't that interested in a rig with 21 running GoPros, so it was pretty clear that the myth that sharkswill attack a GoPro thinking it's food was busted. Now to be fair, they can almost certainly sensethat electrical field, which is whythey would sometimes bump it out of curiosity.  It's just that it would be such a differentelectromagnetic signature from what they'd evolvedfor hundreds of millions of years to consider food. So, you're totally cool to whip out your GoPronext time you find yourself surrounded by sharks. And so while we did have some cool bullet time shotsand a busted myth, what we didn't have was Noah's front row seat to a feeding frenzy. But luckily I had another backup plan, because before we got in, I introduced himto my secret recipe from last year, the super chum smoothie. And while it might make us humans gag,  sharks love this stuff. So, the plan was to have the boat crew fill this canisterwith the super chum and then drop it overboard, hopefully creating a real life sharknado on the way down. And now since our experiment had concluded down below, I let the boat crew know it was time for plan B.  We got the sharknado. Here we go. Coming in hot. There it is!Oh, it's coming down fast! (laughs) Oh, it hit the bottom. They're converging!They're definitely agitated, they're moving around it tryingto figure out what's in the box. Oh, they're really going for it now. (laughs) Yeah! Sharknado!Sharknado!- [Luke] One of the sharks just bit to your right. - [Noah] No way. I think our smoothies worked. - [Mark] Dude, they like what we've done.  - [Noah] Why's it feel like there's, like, double the amount of sharks now?   - [Luke] Hey guys, they're getting pretty gnarly. I want you back, back, back!- [Mark] Ooh, they love it. Yeah, this getting crazy, I think we better hit the boat.  - [Luke] Time to head up. - [Mark] Okay. So with feeding frenzy crossed off the bucket list, and even another dive later where Andy captured this footageof a super rare great hammerhead, Noah innocently inquired about a creepy looking lighthouse near our dive spot. We should ask if we could explore it. - Oh God. - You know what?   What's the deal with the lighthouse?   - It was brought here in 1952, and that's when they actually had the first accident. There was a ship that wrecked here,  and everyone died except for one kid. This five year old. He survived, they found him and everything. But they said that you see a spirit herethey call the gray lady. And on a full moon you can hear her moaning at night for her son, you know?   So it's pretty spooky, man. - What's the name of it?   Does it have a name?   - So, I mean it's called the Great Isaacsbut the locals call it the Ghost Island. - Of course they do. (laughs)- (laughs) A lot of spooky stuff, man. - We should- - Should we check it out?    - Yeah, we should. Are we cool?   Can we go explore the lighthouse?   - [Andy] Yeah. (Mark laughs) - No problem. - All right. - Andy said it was cool. (laughs)- [Noah] Let's get to it. - And while this was possibly a really bad idea, it would be a good chance to gather some firsthand evidence behind all the Bermuda Triangle lore. Dude, I thought that was the gray lady. And so we started exploring and just the whole vibefor this place was legitimately creepy. Now, I'm not gonna show you everythingthat happened on Ghost Island. To see that, you gotta get Discovery Plus,  'cause it has all the Shark Week showthis year and from past years, like my show with Shaq and Dude Perfect. Not to mention my upcoming engineering revenge showbased off the glitter bombs. So to get it, just download Discovery Plusfor free for seven days, and after that,  it's just like five bucks a month. So, this excursion was a useful data point for meas to whether or not the Bermuda Triangle itself was cursed. Oh dude, this is just somethingthe gray lady would wear, too. But I still wasn't ready to form a conclusive viewpointuntil I could do a bit more research myself.  And so after encountering the largest hurdleI've ever seen by a factor of four, we hopped back on the boat to return home. It was a long day and we needed to get some rest, because the next day we were gonna hop on somereal fancy snow globe submarines and descend way down to try and lure some sharks out deep on their own turf. And to do that, I had a few more tricks up my sleeve. And the first trick was this stuff. Now it doesn't look all that impressive like this, but when you simply add it to water, something remarkable happens.  It's called BioLume, and it's the exact samechemical reaction that occurs in naturewhen an organism uses bioluminescence. It's totally non-toxic and naturalto the point that you could drink this water. I mean, how cool is this?   When we're deep underwater, I wanna see how well the sharks can see this stuff because it's commonly saidthat sharks have really bad eyesight. But I've heard that, too, is a myth. That each one of their senses has a different range. Their electro receptors we demonstrated earlierare effective to hunt prey in about this range.  And in previous years, I've investigated the rangeon their sense of smell for something like bloodin the right conditions and it can be as much as a mile. But allegedly they rely quite a biton their sense of sight for hunting, too. And they can see as far as a football field in length.  And while they can't see in colorsand could only see in black and white, their night vision is 10 times better than us humans, which is why we wanted to test their eyeswith this glowing stuff in darker conditions. And my second trick was good old, reliable super chum,  but with a catch, because you can't exactlyjust open the hatch and pour some outwhen you're 600 feet underwater. Plus, there are some pretty strict safety protocolsabout what you can attach to the outsideof the sub due to the crushing pressures at that depth.  So, we handcrafted this beauty. An environmentally friendly super chum torpedowe could fire from the sub. Everything is made from woodand this middle section is balsa wood, so it would easily break away if a shark chomp right here, because that's where the super chum is contained in a bag that biodegrades in the water. And as you can see from our last minute pool testing, the idea was for the sub's mechanical armto pull this lever, which would allowthe surgical tubing to contract, forcing the torpedo out, opening the bag of super chumin the process, but intentionally only traveling a short distance, where we could still see it close to the sub. So with our final test looking pretty good, it was time to head back out to seafor both of our first ever dives in a bonafide submarine. (Mark laughs)- Oh my God.  Which one's mine?   - I think you're this one, Old Yeller. - [Noah] Oh my God. - [Mark] Look at this. - Shall we get in?   - Let's do it. (dramatic music)(seagulls squawk) - [Nomad Operator] This is Nomadreporting that hatch is secure and I am ready to dive. - Top Side, Nemo, please dive. - Oh my God!(dramatic music) (peaceful piano music) - Nemo, good to see ya. You ready to go on a 270?   - Okay, Nomad, I'm ready when you are. (peaceful piano music) - So, we're at 130 feet right now. - Yeah. - And we're going 600.- We're gonna go deep, man. - This is Nomad reporting. We are approaching the edge of the wall.  - [Mark] And the wall was basically a sheer underwater clifflike the Grand Canyon, and we were going over it. On the way down, at around 300 feet, you could see signs of where a coastline used to bebefore the end of the Ice Age when all the glaciers melted.  And he said everywhere he dives around the world, you see the same thing at about that same depth. And the deeper we went, the darker it got. Now it was time to lure some sharks out. - Yeah, let's settle down here. I'm gonna get the manipulator going.  I'll let you drive this. - Oh, wow. This is like the arcade, playing the claw game. Nice!Oh, yes, yes.  Look at that glow. - [Nemo Operator] Nomad, Nomad, Nemo. We are ready to fire the torpedo. - [Nomad Operator] We are attempting now.  Oh, torpedo launched. - Yeah, baby. We launched it! (laughs) - Woohoo! (laughs)- [Nemo Operator] Secondary torpedo launch now. Ooh. (laughs)- Oh, my. No way! - [Mark] And with a bit of an assist, the second chum torpedo was in play. And now the sharks just come swimming. Here sharky, sharky, sharky. (suspenseful music) And as we waited, it dawned on me that as humans, we were almost certainly the firstand quite possibly the last to everexplore this exact spot on planet earth. (suspenseful music) Oh, the fish are coming. Whoa, yeah, dude. The fish love it. Whoa, whoa! (laughs) (peaceful music)And a number of times, we thought we sawsome sharks lurking in the shadows, but it was always just fleeting glimpses. So, we decided to try our luck at a different spota bit higher up the wall with our remaining two torpedoes.  (dramatic music) - I think I see some. - Oh, I see one out there. - [Mark] You see one?   - Way out in the distance. - [Nemo Operator] Oh, there's a shark. - Oh my God. - There's more. - [Mark] And here we hit jackpot. - [Nemo Operator] Whoa, look at 'em all.  - When they bump it, you feel the whole sub rock. That's terrifying. Yes. Oh, you're angry. He's right on it. - [Noah] Oh my God. - Oh, he's right underneath us. Holy cow.  (upbeat music)That's rad. Look at that. Top Side, this is Mark. Chumpedo worked flawlessly. We are surrounded by sharks. And so with mission accomplished and our air running low,  we decided to make our way back to the surface. The BioLume was just so cool, but admittedly, we sort of confounded our experiment by releasingthe chum torpedo at the same time. So, we still wanted to see up close if the sharkswill be able to see it with their night vision and then come check it out. And with the subs already put away, that meant we had to get in the oceanin the Bermuda Triangle in the middle of the night. I make a point of not swimming in the ocean at night. I especially make a point of not swimmingin the ocean at night surrounded by sharks. - Right. I feel like that's just general knowledge. You don't go in the ocean at night. - That's a good rule of thumb. If it wasn't the sharks that would kill me, it would be my family, when they saw my ability to make poor choices. - [Mark] Okay Noah, here we go baby.  All right, buddy, you ready?   - [Noah] I'm scared. - [Mark] Okay, we need the bottle of stuff.  (dramatic music)- [Mark] This is bonkers. Oh, that's cool, dude!That's like X-Men. I think you guys can throw a bunch on top.  Whoa. That's crazy. Look at that.  That's cool. - [Noah] I feel like I'm in a dream. - [Mark] This seems pretty cool, but I want try it with like, with no lights.  Okay, total darkness. Super not okay with this. Now, let's try it like this.  Oh, this is a lot creepier now. With no lights on. This is the trippiest thing I've ever seen, man. (suspenseful music) All right. All right, we got blue. Whoa, shark, Noah, shark, shark! A shark just swam by. - [Noah] Where?   Oh my God. (Mark screams)- I'm starting to notice bigger gapsin this chain link fence all the- - [Noah] This is the scariest thing I've ever done. (suspenseful music)(Mark screams)- [Noah] Oh my God, this is unreal. (Mark screams) - Another, oh my God!There's a sizable hole in this cage. Who made this thing?   (dramatic music)Holy crap. (laughs) Oh. - [Luke] And you guys are good to come out. - Okay. - Hold on, hold on. - [Luke] Yep, thanks. - Oh my God, that was the scariest thingI've ever done in my entire life.  That was unreal. There's like 10 sharks circling around us, like, I thought they were trying to eat us. That's actually my nightmare. Like that- (Mark laughs)- it can't get scarier than that. - We threw the BioLume off, and then pretty soonwe flipped the lights on, there's was bunch of sharks, so.  BioLume went in, sharks came. (crew members clap) - Nicely done!- Nice dog, we did it. - Come on, let's get the rigs. - Once again, it was an incredible experienceto learn more about our friends, the sharks, and as a bonus, I survived.  Which leads us to our final unanswered question. Is the Bermuda Triangle really cursed?   Has it caused the mysterious disappearanceof thousands of boats and planes?   As a kid, I loved reading books about this, trying to unravel the mystery.  And as an adult with a background in science, I was shocked to discover that significantlymore boats and planes do disappear there. But, there's a catch. At a random moment, you can open a flight tracking website and take a snapshot of all the planes in the airand it will look something like this. Now keep in mind, this region here is the Bermuda Triangle. Can you spot the problem?   Way more boats and planes crash there, because way more boats and planes travel there. It's in the middle of some of the most heavily used shipping routes and flight paths in the world. It's like how California is the state withthe most car accidents because it has the most people, not because there's some supernaturalforce causing them all. Statistically speaking, the Bermuda Triangleis no more dangerous for a single boat or plane than anywhere else. And you can double check that answer in the back of the bookby checking if insurance companies charge any morefor vessels traveling through that region. And it turns out, they don't. And yet, as sure as I am about my conclusion,  our first mate, Andre, had a wayof telling firsthand stories that even I'll admitchipped away at my resolve just a little bit. - We had some guys fly in, like, this magnetic fieldrunning through and up to this day, they still can't tell what it is.  Bermuda Triangle, guys. You never know, man. You never know. (upbeat music)(Mark screams) (snowballs thump)\n","- This is a bird feeder, and everything you seesurrounding me in my yard is an attempt to protect itfrom four thieving squirrels. If they want the birdseed and the lifetime supplyof walnuts in this bank vault, they'll first need to pass through my nine-part obstacle course. By design, it's extremely challenging. It's meant to test their mental limitsand their physical limits. I held back no punches, but I have to admit, in hindsight,  I once again completely underestimated my adversary. And truthfully, I never thought I'd be that crazy guyin the neighborhood obsessing over the squirrels,  but they started it first when they wouldconstantly pillage the birdseedfrom any bird feeder I would put up about a year ago. That led to me defending it with an obstacle course, which they handily defeated, and so after a year of ruminating on how to avenge that L with a majorly improved versionand then two months of planning, my buddy John and Igot together for a 20-second build montage.  (upbeat music)(tools whirring) (nuts clattering) Here are the basic elements. For starters, here's their favorite bird feeder, at the end of the course, and it's sitting atop Fort Knuts, the most secure walnut vault in the western United States.  Now since birds can fly, they can come and goas they please and eat all the food they want, but the only way for the squirrels to make it right hereis by surviving my nine-part grueling obstacle course which all starts right here. Climbing up this pole to this platformis the single gateway to enter the course. Every other pole you see has some kind of countermeasure to keep the squirrel from just climbing upand then entering the course halfway through. And so the first challenge is this casino, which may seem like an odd choiceuntil you realize that as we were building the course,  we also built them some cozy little squirrel houses. So we put them up in a couple different treesand after a few days, it looked like they'd actuallymade some renovations, so I went to take a closer look and sure enough, here's the before and here's the after. Even on the inside, they made some questionable decor updates. So while it might look like they were just using the housesto relax, or stretch, or look out the window, or wrestle,  the satellite communications gearand the tactical mission planningand the mini vault to practice cracking a safe told a completely different story. This gang of four high-end professional birdseed thieveswere secretly planning to pull offan honest to goodness \"Mission: Impossible, \"\"Ocean's 11\" style mega walnut heist,  which is why I was gonna protectthe birdseed and walnut vaultwith the most state-of-the-art security measuresjust like the casino did in \"Ocean's 11.\"So once in the casino, you'll see the slot machine and the classic Vegas buffet, but with the warning:take more than an ounce, you're gonna nap to deal with security. Now that I got the squirrels on the run, they'll naturally want to jump to this bar but there's a twist. It actually twists, which I thinkis gonna give 'em some problems, but if they can figure this out, they'll jump into this crate, and the good news is that it's filled in the brimwith their favorite food, which is walnuts, and I know this 'cause I tested a bunch of different optionsand they always went with the walnuts first. But the bad news is that once you add a little weightto the system, the helicopter starts moving just like the helicopter from \"Mission: Impossible. \"Oh, and we've got a baffle here at the topto stop a squirrel from just crawlingalong the wire from the fence. The helicopter stops next to this wall,  which seems simple enough, except that the bricksrandomly move and adjust themselves in and out. And of course, at any time, if they fall off, they gotta go back and start over the whole course from the beginning. After that, we come to their hideout, and this is when they'll switch from defense to offensebecause it's where they hang out and plan. You can see it's sort of messy with their tools and their blueprints on the wall that showif they open the floor on the elevator, the elevator shaft leads them undergroundand into the sewers. Then if they crawl through the sewers, it will take them right to the control center for a second room that might look familiar. And just like in \"Mission: Impossible, \"their goal is to go up through the ceilingto access the air vents, but there's no wayto make it up there unless they type the password into the keyboard in the control room next door, like this. (motor whirring) And at that point, they can climb the ladderand they're in the vents, and the vents are a total maze. There's lots of different twists and turnsthey'll need to navigate up here, So at any moment, if they're too lost,  they can always exit the whole courseby using the one-way squirrel emergency exit, which also exists for any enclosed room on the whole course. And for the penultimate challenge,  it's back down from the air ductsthrough this laser maze, where they'll have to harnesstheir inner Catherine Zeta-Jones. If they sufficiently touch any of the lasers, the metal base contacts and completes the circuit,  which sends a signal from this microcontroller to a relayto a solenoid, which causes this pneumatic piston to fire, which slams this door shut for one minute. And because I'm basically certain they'll try and get to this point by climbing from the roofon top of this tube, I've placed a shield herewith another enforcement squirrel to try and deter them. And so finally, if they've made it through the laser maze and everything that came before it, they've made it to Fort Knuts, and as far as I'm concerned, if they crack the safe by giving this handle a little turn, they've earned every last walnut in this bank.  After the course was set up, they could definitely smell the walnuts in the vaultand then you could see them sort ofworking things out from the fence line.  And so after two months of prep work, it was time to test our extensive security measuresagainst this formidable set of 500-gram rodents. (light music) And right out of the gate, we got him with the buffet. And as he sticks his entire face under the sneeze guard, absentmindedly reading the sign,  you can see the exact moment he realizeshe might have screwed up. And the slow-mo shows Rick just really laying himself out.  Oh, by the way, that's Rick. All four squirrels have names, and more importantly, like any crew looking to pull off a heist, they all have specific roles to play,  starting with everyone's favorite, Phat Gus, who of course is the mastermind of this operation. On a heist, this is the roleof the Frank Ocean or an Ethan Hunt. Now, I just have to say for those who aren't familiar,  last year I named one of the squirrels Phat Gusbecause he loved to eat and was a little on the hefty side, but then halfway through, I noticed he had nipples, which it turns out means he was actually a girl and a pregnant one at that, so it was just a whole PR disaster, and I switched the name to Phantastic Gusand Rephrased a few other thingsbut to be honest, Phantastic Gus just doesn't roll off the tongue like Phat Gus, so I asked permissionto use my preferred phrasing and as you can see, I got full consent. Next up is Rick. He's the acrobat, the grease man, the gutsy one.  He's the go-to for any taskthat is gonna require some athletic abilities. And then we've got Marty, he's the hacker. Anything with computers or bank safes, and he's your guy,  but while he's really smart, he also scares pretty easy. And finally, we've got Frank with logistics. A good heist starts with a good plan. He's got the whole course memorized and he's mapped it out and provided blueprints for the team. And so back to the course, we've got Marty the hacker here, who, again, is a bit skittish, so you can seehe's coming in pretty cautious. But who can resist a buffet?    Once again, the real magic is found in the slow-mo.  Eventually they realized security was just too tightat this casino, and Rick goes straight to the twist bar. Excellent. Here's try two.  (light music)And with some motivation form the bird, he's like, \"I got this, I got this, I got this.  I don't think I got this. \"The real time replay on this one is great too. (person screaming)And at this point, Phat Gus is like,  \"I'm gonna get that crate of walnuts. Let me show you how it's done. \"Which turns out somewhat predictably. (light music) Now really frustrated, acrobat daredevil Ricktries a totally different route.  (light music)I gave this a 9. 5, but sorry Rick, the Russian judge gave it a six. You gotta stick the landing. Logistics man Frank knows the wire connected to the fence leads to the helicopter crate, so he triessneaking in the back door and is also forced to retreat. And finally, Marty the hacker realizes if you're just scared and you run real fast, the bar doesn't have time to spin on you, and you can see Rick just replicating the strategy. So after about two days, all of them could cruise through the first part of this course about this fast, and Fort Knuts was already feeling less and less secure. Phat Gus is like, \"Wait, is this thing moving?    I'm good. \" Here, Rick Hypothesizes if he doesn't sit in the crate, it won't move, and here he rejects that hypothesiswith a legendary leap, and now is a good time to remind ourselves that squirrelsare one of the few mammals that can survivea fall from any height, because as you can see here, they make their body super flat to increase drag, effectively becoming their own parachute.  But just in case, you okay Rick?   \"Yep. All good. \"And Marty the hacker fraidy cat is just like, \"Yeah, I am super not down with this. \" Eventually it's the fearless leader Phat Guswho demonstrates the ride is definitely worth it.  And soon you've got Frankand the rest of the gang following suit, which leads us to the wall of a thousand moving bricks. And first up, you got Phat Gus, who kicks things right off with a pull of his parachute. And Rick just barely misses. Skittish Marty gets one taste of a moving brick and absolutely yeets himself into this tree. And while there were plenty of instanceswhere a moving brick did dump the squirrels, causing them to start over from the beginning,  what was even better was Marty psyching himself outin the anticipation that a brick might move, even though the wall wasn't powered onfor any of these clips. (light music) And thanks in part to the dutiful supervision of Phat Gus, eventually, like all the other challenges so far, they got it down to a science where they could cruise by the wall fairly quickly. (light music)And now's a good time to mention, the squirrels weren't the only ones attempting the course. This is Splinter the rat, and here he is with one of his buddies.  He liked to make the rounds to all the houses each night, which sometimes were vacant and sometimes they weren't. There goes frank to chase him off his lawn. And you might've noticed the stuff in the house. The squirrels would gather nesting materials from various sources, or somewhat hilariously, just steal from each other. Here's a bonus Santa Claus impressionfor all the Phat Gus fans out there. So from Splinter and his buddies to not at all creepy possums. there's a surprisingly constant variety of wildlifethat passes through a suburban backyard, including a dumb dog who, for some reason,  is much less interested in squirrelsthan he is my camera gear, which is a lovely segueback to the squirrel hideout, where the heist was really just picking up steam. (\"Mission: Impossible\" theme)  (\"Mission: Impossible\" theme continues)    And after hacker Marty had accessed the computer and lowered the ladder, Phat Gus followed behindand joined him in the vents, but in the process, a critical tool dropped down, which led to a lovely recreation of an iconic scene.  (\"Mission: Impossible\" theme) And as a side note, they figured out the exit door pretty quickly, and they functioned as a one-way door exactly as intended.  And now with the vents, it was Frank's time to shine. You can see here he's just double checkingthe actual air duct layouts to make surethey match the blueprints he's memorized,  and once he's satisfied, he steps up, and as you can see, he nails it first try. You can just sense his confidence here. (light music) Contrast that with Marty, who's like, \"All right, I think it was a right, no, it was straight. Oh, was it Left?    Crap, I gotta go check the map again, \" and as a result, most of his runswould end up looking something like this. So here's Frank coaching him from the outside. , And you can see Marty's a little defensive about it.  So Frank hops in so they can work out their differences, and then with a little encouragement, he gets him going down the right way.  All the while, Phat Gus continues to supervise. Focus, Marty. There you go. (light music) Which brings us to the laser maze. Here's acrobat Rick's first approachand he's like, \"Yeah, that sucks. \"And just as expected, he climbs on top of the tube and he's like, \"Yeah, I totally got this, \"when in fact, he didn't have it. In real time, it happens so fast, it just looks like chaos.  But if we slow down this second attempt, we can remind ourselves of how squirrelshave mastered the laws of physicsto always land on their feet.  Did you catch it?   The first is the locking of the headon a landing target in less than 300 milliseconds. If you go back and watch any jump from this video, that locking of their head is the first thing they always do, and the secondis using conservation of angular momentumlike an ice skater to pull their arms and legsin and out at the right times to rotate fastand then hold in the right orientation.  Combine those two tricks with the flat body parachuteand extending their legs at the last minuteto absorb the shock, and they're perfectly adaptedfor living high in the trees. In fact, squirrels have been around for over 30 million years and they've had to evolverelatively little in all that time. So then Rick's like, \"Fine, I'll use the stupid tubelike a normal squirrel. What is this?    See, I knew this was suss. \"And here's Frank, who just watched what happenedand therefore is appropriately cautious.  But he hops right back on the saddleand this time he nails it. And in the end, it feels appropriate that the Mastermind Phat Gus was the first oneto make it successfully through the laser mazeand then to subsequently make it to Fort Knuts.  I mean, how Phat Gus is this?   Falling not just for one decoy nut, but for both of 'em, which paves the wayfor Marty the hacker to be the one to crack the safe,  and as you could see here, he's pretty stoked about it. (light music)And first he just checks it out like,  \"Yep, mm-hmm, yep. This is just like the schematic showed, \"And then the big moment. (nuts clattering) (light music) once the safe opened, these cargo nets unfurled, which just allowed better access to their loot. But interestingly, more often than not, after getting a walnut, instead of jumping off, they would go all the way back through the course.  Here's jumpy Marty exhibiting some real PTSD, even though I'd already turned off the whole system. So once again, the squirrels took the Wbut as far as I'm concerned, they earned it,  and I can't complain how things turned out, 'cause Rick buried all his extra nuts in the yard, Marty and Frank made up and rekindled their friendship, and Phat Gus got some long sought quality time with the bird feeder, so everyone was happy. Well, almost everyone. (bird chirping)\n","- [Mark] You've probably received a lot of spam calls(phone ringing)That sound something like this. - [Phone] This is Amazon. comYou have been chargedThree hundred and seventy nine dollars-- [Mark] Now behind this harmless sounding callis a 20 billion dollar scam industry,  and today we're gonna roll over that logand see what crawls out. Because for the past five months, with the help of my trusty glitter bomb, which I typically just reserve for porch pirates, I've worked my way up every rungof the slimy chain of command involved in this scam. This journey is going to take us around the worldand through five states. It involves homeland security, stakeouts with PIs, and of course glitter bombs, and the scammerstrying to hopelessly rid themselves of sparkly evidencebefore getting arrested.  I'm gonna show you exactly how they makeso much money off these calls. So buckle up, cause it gets wild. Now all this started for mewhen I was working on glitter bomb 3. 0 this past Novemberand I kept getting those annoying calls. So I thought maybe to return the favor,  I could send them my harmless box that shoots out glitterand fart spray when you remove the lid. Now my buddy Jim Browning has a YouTube channelwhere he's able to reverse the connectionto the scammer's computerand then thwart them in real timeas they try and scam someone else. My idea was to have a legitimate victim agree to send the money, but then we'd work with themto actually send a glitter bomb instead. So Jim checked all the scammer computershe was currently monitoring, and it just so happened a woman named Tracywas being scammed for $12, 500 at that very moment.  So he immediately tried reaching out to herand eventually got through. (phone ringing)- Hello?   - [Jim] Hello Tracy, this is Jim Browning here again. I'm calling you, hopefully you've got my voicemail. - Here's what happened.  - Now listen carefullyto what Tracy's about to say hereand hold your judgmentabout how could anyone ever send $12000 in the mailuntil I explain how the scam works in a minutebecause I hate to give these guys credit, but it's pretty clever.  - They were supposed to give me a refund of $300and when I put it in the computer, I mistyped it as $13000.So I had to send money back to them $12, 500 and that's where I am. - [Jim] Right. I'm hoping you haven't sent that money. - I have sent it. - [Jim] Oh no. All right. I hate to break this to you, but this whole thing is a scam.  - What do I do now?    Cause they- (stammering)- [Mark] I'll tell you what to do, Tracy. You leave this to me and Jim, the first thing we did was look up the addressthey told her to ship the money to. And given there were six cameras outside, this clearly was some kind of safe house for the scammers.  We then had Tracy call FedEx to cancel the package, but just in case, we hired two PIsto be on the scene that day to intercept it. And we knew we shouldn't do that right in front of the housebecause they'd probably be watching. But since we weren't sure which direction the FedEx truck would come from, we overnight shipped a package to a bunch of their neighborsthat explained they were randomly selectedto win one of these super cool glitter bomb tee shirts. And if you wanted to buy one of these from markrober. comto help support making more videos like this, I'm certainly not gonna stop you.  This would allow us to speak to the delivery driversomewhere up the street to get the package stopped in time. And the plan worked flawlessly. Because despite Tracy's efforts to get it stopped, her package was in fact out on the truck for delivery.  - [PI] Tracy something?    Yeah, that's the one. Don't deliver this one please. - Okay. - This is the fraudulent one. If that one's gone, that's also going to 731?    Okay. - [Mark] But in a wild twist, there was a second packagegoing to the same location, addressed to the same fake name. Her name was Phyllis and we later found out her package contained even more cash than Tracy's. - [PI] Okay, so that one's going back, right?   - Right, definitely. Yeah, that's the stuff. - And FedEx was cool enoughto eventually return the packages, So both Tracy and Phyllis got all their money back.  And when the scammers angrily called Tracy backasking why the package didn't arrive, she explained she accidentally selectedtwo day shipping instead of next day air. So they would get the package tomorrow. And that story switched from defenseto a very light offense. And so the next day we deliver the package in an official looking vest. - [PI] Have a good holiday. - Alright, you too. - Thank you. - [Mark] And waited for the sweet retribution. (box opening noise)- [Machine] Hello!(machine blasting sound)Are you gonna give up?    Or are you thirsty for more?    (machine spray noise)- What the (squeaky toy sound effect)(television ambience)- [Mark] But for the first time in three yearsof glitter bombing criminals (machine spray noise)Someone didn't immediately throw the box outside, and he just sat there with the wretched smell, leaving the box untouched. And then as we waited, wondering what his game plan was gonna be, suddenly a bunch of NYPD officers started showing up and it didn't take them long to figure things out. - It's a glitter bomb. It has a camera built into it. There's a camera built into this. - [Mark] We had a phone number on the boxand they called us up and I explained the whole situation,  and I'll just say there was some mutual admirationfor each other's work. - [Officer] Are there cameras in this thing as well?   Cause this is a hell of a 3D printedlittle thing you got here. (laughs)- I mean there might be cameras on there, officer. And as it happens, the reason a scammer would call the cops on himself is cause he isn't a scammer. This is Gary and it turns out he's a super nice guy. But Gary runs an Airbnb and once you go in that door, there are two rooms upstairs that he rents out to people. So this wasn't a safe house at all.  These scammers would use Airbnb to get a temporary addressthey would only use once. But if that's true, that meant the scammersmust have been there yesterday. So Gary showed us his security footage and we saw this womanin an orange jacket who appeared right as the PI was talking with the FedEx driver up the street. She also looks directly at the camera and then decidesit's probably cold enough outside to zip her jacketall the way up. Once the FedEx truck passes, and she realizes he skipped by her, she hurries over to talk to him. And when he told her he had nothing for her for that day,  she walks right back to her car, never stepping foot inside the Airbnb. The PI's got all the license plates on the street that dayand it turns out her name is Crystal. You should remember that name for later. So then Gary showed us who booked the room.  It was this guy from Utah with a brand new accountand zero reviews. In fact, when the reservation was booked, he sent this message in awkward English at 3:06 AM, which happens to be just after lunch in India.  So I did some more research and learned thatafter the scammer in India found a willing victim, they would use a money muleand have the victim send the cash there. So Crystal in this case was the mule, but instead of sending the package tothe Money Mule's house, they use an Airbnb. Then the Mule gives the package to his supervisor,  who deposits the cash and wire transfers the remaining moneyback to the scammer. And they must have got spooked cause Crystal was long gonethe next day, which meant we caughtpoor Gary in the crossfire, but he wanted them caught just as much as us. So we compensated him handsomely just for being cool about everything. So we'll call that round a tie. We stopped the scammers from receiving two packagescontaining $30000, but they were still glitter-free. But before I show you exactly how we tipped the scalesin our favor, let me explain exactlyhow this scam works so well at tricking so many people. There's an email that goes along with the scamthat basically says the same thing as the robocall, which is Amazon just charged you $200, but if you don't recognize this charge, please call right away to have it refunded. So when you call, they sayI'd be happy to walk you through the refund process on your computer. So just type this here and simply install thisand then I'll be able to fully help you out. And most victims don't really comprehendthey've just installed a remote software program that givesthe scammers full access to their computer. Now they're ready for the scam. They tell her that some accounts have actually already had their refunds automatically processed. So she needs to check her bank account to make surethe $200 refund isn't already there. And when Bessie here asks if he can see her banking info, he explains in technical terms-- [Scammer] It's a 3D page, so I cannot see anything.  - [Bessie] Oh. Oh, okay. - [Mark] And so sure enough, she hasn't got the refund yet, so he needs just about five minutes to work withhis billing department in order to process it. But first, he makes a really big deal about this. - [Scammer] I'm signing out from your account in front of your own eyes. - [Mark] And this is true, he actually does sign outat which point he triggers her screen to go blackso she can't see anything that he's doing. And then he immediately logs back in using the browserpre-stored username and password. He's gonna do a simple browser HTML edit on this page to temporarily make this Lowe's purchaselook like a refund for $20000, and you'll see why in a minute. And as he's editing away, he chats her upto try and build trust. - [Scammer] You are like my granny Miss Bessie, do you know this?    - [Bessie] Yes!- [Scammer] She was like one of my closest friends- [Bessie] Ohhh- [Scammer] I used to share each and everything with her. - [Mark] You mean like what you do for a living?   And you might be wondering why doesn't he just wire transferhimself money while he has unrestricted accessto her account?   But the problem there is that it's traceable and it would likely get flaggedby the bank's fraud detection system anyways. But if you can get an old lady to mail you cash, it's so untraceable the authorities don't even beginto try and track it down. Now that he's finished, he un-blanks her screenand he informs her that unfortunately the billing department couldn't process the refund, so they have one last option to try. - [Scammer] This is the Chase online different server. - [Mark] It's actually just a text windowthat does absolutely nothing. It's pure theater. - [Scammer] It is an irreversible form. Whatever you're typing it over there,  put it in a correct manner, nothing would be changed over here. - [Mark] Basically makes a big deal for three minutesthat she's the one that has to enter all the informationand anything that gets typed there is immediately permanent. Maybe you can see where this is headed. So her name, last four of social, zip code,  and finally refund amount. - [Scammer] Please enter your refund amount. (keyboard typing)- [Mark] If you go back, you could actually hear him typethe two extra zeros on his keyboard and hit enter. - [Scammer] Check everything, is it correct?    - [Bessie] Oh no, this is a mistake!Oh, I screwed up. - [Scammer] Oh, Jesus!- I'm, it was supposed to be a 200 in there. Oh God almighty. I'm exhausted, I can't do this! My mind is absolutely fried. - [Scammer] Ma'am please check your account. Please check your account. Did you really receive that money in your account?   Oh my God. Plus twenty thousand!- [Bessie] Yeah. . . - [Scammer] Please save my job, ma'am. If I'm not earn for my family,  my family will die due to hunger, due to starvation. Please ma'am. - [Bessie] Yes, of course!- [Scammer] Please don't cry- [Bessie] I mean, what should I do?   - [Scammer] I also feel bad for you, you are also like my grandmother. - [Bessie] You know I'm am honest person, I'm-- [Scammer] You are making me cry now, you are making me cry now. You're. . .  I'm getting attached to you. - [Bessie] Now how do I fix this?   - [Mark] He tells her that unfortunatelymailing a check or wiring money would just take too long. So he needs to think for a minute, and then he comes back with this. - [Scammer] Hello Miss Bessie?   - [Bessie] Yes?   - [Scammer] I got an option.  - And you can see now how he's got her to the pointwhere she's totally willing to send $20000 in the mailand to lie to the folks at the bank or FedEx, or even her family who might try and stop it. In her mind, she messed up, and because she's a good empathetic person,  she'll go through great lengths to make it rightfor someone she doesn't realize is a heartless scammer. And on top of weaponizing their empathy, maintaining pressure on their victim is a key tactic. They keep them on the phone the whole time, even as they drive to the bank or they yell at them.  - [Scammer] Go to the UPS! Why don't you go to the UPS?   !- [Mark] Or call this many times in a row. And if you've ever seen this clip-- Name a woman. - Name a woman?   - Yes!- Umm. . . - [Mark] You already know when you're under extreme stress,  it's an actual biological response for the part of our brainthat does critical thinking to just shut down. - Why is this so hard?   - Name a woman!- [Mark] Once they're back from the bank with the cash, they coach them through packing it. In Tracy's case, they had her put $100 billsin the pages of a bookso it couldn't be detected in the mail.  In other cases, they have the victims wrap the cashin saran wrap so the dogs can't sniff it, and then foil so it can't be x-rayed. And unfortunately, there's a small portion of the populationthat are just too trusting for their own good. And sadly, it's nearly always older folks.  So for the scammers, it's just a game of percentagesto find them. According to data Jim has gatheredfrom the scammer's own computers, In one shift, a call center like thiswith about 25 employeeswill send out a half a million robocalls; they'll get about 500 calls backand land maybe five to ten victimslike Bessie or Tracy or Phyllis. And speaking of Phyllis, after we got FedEx to send back her package, I was able to get in touch with her sonand I found out her husband of 40 years had passed away the very week she was being scammed of her life savings. The scammers knew she was mourning this loss. But once you're scammed, your phone number's really valuablebecause it means you're an easy mark. So they sold her info to other scammersand she was scammed twice more the same week her husband died. And as hard as it was for me to even hear a backstorylike that, it just made me that much more motivatedto seek some glitter bomb retributionfor all the Phyllises out there, and perhaps in the process we might stumble upon some good informationthat we could pass on to the authorities. So now we needed another scammer to send a glitter bomb to, But we decided when Jim spots a scam in progress, it's better for him just to stop it coldand not stress out the victimany more then they already are. So we reached out to our friend Pierogi from the YouTube channel Scammer Paybackbecause whenever Pierogi gets a scam callto his actual phone, he turns on his cameras, makes his voice sound like an old lady, and has some fun. - [Scammer] If they will ask you in your banklike why you are withdrawing this much of cash,  what you gonna tell them?   - [Pierogi] Um, I'm getting it for Derek Wilsonfrom Microsoft. - [Scammer] No, no ma'am! No!You need to tell them that you're withdrawing the cashfor your personal reason, for your personal reason! - [Mark] And it didn't take long for fake victimold woman Pierogi to get us an address in New Jersey. - [Pierogi] This where I'm sending it to?   - [Scammer] Right. Grab box, right?    So you can put the cash. - [Pierogi] Yeah, I've already got a box. I already got a box, it's big enough. - [Mark] This one was actually to a hotel and not an Airbnb,  but as soon as we pulled up, once again a money mule was out there waiting for us. - Y'all have a package for Jaquelin?   - [PI] For Jaquelin?    I just need you to sign here. You two have a good day. - [Mark] So they took the package and drove aroundfor a couple of hours and when it was clear they weren't going to open it, we made the call just to get the box backbefore the batteries died, and then maybe the box audio recording might help uspiece together more info on the scam. - [PI] You guys picked up a box from FedEx today, part of a scam?   - I didn't have no scam going on today.  - [PI] Oh really?   - No. - [PI] Let's see the box. - I just was told-- [PI] I understand. - By somebody to pick this up for them. - [PI] I understand. - Yeah, I don't know what's going on. I'm being honestly and truthfullyand I don't want no trouble. - And when I first heard that, I was like, Oh, well now I feel bad.  Sometimes these mules don't even realizethey're participating in scamsand they might even be victims themselves. Then I was like, look, not that I don't believe her, but maybe just in case, we just havea little peek at the audio. - [Mule] How have we done so many packages?   (laughs) I don't even know which one is which anymore. - [Mark] Then she got on the phone with her boss James. - [Mule] Yeah, I know, I got one with me right now. I took the picture and sent it to you. I'm gonna bring it to you. That's what I'm saying, you said that I was done for the day.  Where I gotta be at tomorrow?   You said that we was working out here in New Jersey. I don't know!Wherever they give me an address at. They don't even have the Airbnb addressesor nothing for tomorrow. This the first time they split me and Crystalup like this in in New Jersey!- That's right. Crystal.  Apparently they're a team, which means Jaquelin was probably in the carthe other day in New York. - And the other time she's in the car watching me. She don't do (squeaky toy sound effect). - By the way, Crystal, hate to say it, but Jacqueline was talking a lot of trash about you. In fact, I'd watch your back. Cause her cousin in the car that day might be gunning for your job. - [Woman] I wanna be a driver. How much do they get paid?   How much you get for that one parcel?   - [Jacqueline] Bout a hundred dollars. Everybody's getting paid the same. So we get seven parcel and it's seventy five dollarsor a hundred dollars for each parcel.  Everybody's getting seven hundred dollars. You're gonna be back and forth. You're gonna be either in Florida, Delaware, Maryland, you gonna be here, there, there, there, there. You're gonna be looking like you on vacationhaving the time of your life. Yeah, I don't know what's going on.  I'm being honestly and truthfully and-- We learned two key things here. The first is that a supervisor will havemultiple mules reporting to them, who apparently get flown all over the countryand just one mule could receive as many asseven packages in a day. And the second is that this address was from a totally different call center in India. So that same supervisor can work withmultiple unrelated scammers as well. And so in the spirit of avenging Phyllis, if we were gonna glitter bomb and fart sprayanyone here in the States, we really wanted it to be a supervisor.  And thanks to Pierogi, not long after, we would get another chance. - [Scammer] Uh, get the 50000 dollarsin cash with you, get in your car. Once you're in your car, let me know. Make sure you don't involve any third person. Nobody!- [Pierogi] So I don't need to tell my husband?    - [Scammer] Your husband, your daughter, anyone. - [Mark] This one would be in Illinois. And the delivery address this time was to a Walgreens. It was interesting to see them experimenting withdifferent package drop off methods. And right away we heard some good news. - [PI] Meet me at the gas station then.  - [Man] Okay. - [PI] Yeah, I see you. I see you. Come park in front of me. - [Man] Which car are you in?   - [PI] In the black one. - [Mark] The Walgreens was here, and the handoff occurredhere at this gas station. (shuffling noises)And with that, we had our supervisor.  (video game power-up noise)We tailed the supervisor for a few minutesand got a good look at his 2019 white Honda Passport. And then 20 minutes later he stopped hereat a seemingly random parking lot and opened it. - [Machine] Hello!(machine shooting noise) - [Mark] And even though he kept it by his feet, the cameras got a perfect shot of his face here. (camera shutter)And the PIs assessed the situation and felt safe enoughto approach him right after he opened it, but then he took off, and they let him go, And we just used the GPS in the glitter bombs to once again locate it in the ditch snow. And right after that, Pierogi got this messagefrom this scammer in India, which shows two things. The supervisor and scammerare in close contact with each other, and neither one likes glitter. And that seemed like the end of the storyuntil we ran the plates and realized his name was tied to a businessreally close to where he opened the box. So we went back a week later to get footageto show just how close. Here's where he opened it. You could seethat dumpster and house for reference, And then you pan over, and that's the businesshis name is tied to.  And wait a second, that's a 2019 Honda passport. And wait another second, That's the same guy whose face is on cameraopening the glitter bomb. So this was a nice little package of intelwe were able to hand off to the authoritiesbecause the supervisor is sort of the hub and a direct connection between a bunch of mulesin the states and a bunch of scammers in India. Pierogi came through with one final address in Texasand this one was back to the MOof being delivered to an Airbnb. And like all the others, the mules right there waiting for us,  and then she took it inside to open it. - [Machine] Hello!(machine shooting noise)You guys give up?    Or are you thirsty for more?   (machine spraying noise) - [Mark] Notice how she films herself opening the package. Apparently this is pretty commonbecause I suppose there's no honor among thievesand the scammers will demand the videoto confirm she hasn't taken more than she's allowed. As we learned before,  the money mules make a flat amount per package, like a hundred bucks. But I ended up reading somewhere that the supervisorgets a 10% cut and sends the rest back to the scammers. This lady later admitted she herselfwas exchanging the cash for Bitcointo send back to the scammers,  which meant she was actually a supervisor. And for the sake of Phyllis, that was a lovely surprise. - It seems the package may be in motion as well. - [Mark] She took off and parked about a mile away, but the police were alertedand were on her tail pretty quickly.  - Ma'am, do you have your ID on you?   - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I cannot park here?   - [Mark] I love that attempt at just getting awaywith the parking warning. So she gets outta the car and I have toapplaud the effort here. But as every parent knows, the only way she's getting rid of the evidencefrom her pants and car is by burning them both to the ground. - What do you got all that glitter on your pants for?   - Yeah, so I just- I don't know. My uh, lawyer cause I'm in uh, probation, tell my probation officer, I don't know what's happened. Okay, so I want to contact with with, err, someone.  - [Mark] And so after she was taken into custody, the police returned to the Airbnb to gather evidence. The dude on the left there is a detective and they alreadyhad her under investigation for another package scam. So now they're bringing charges against herand the actual glitter bomb and footage is being held as evidence in the case. We did one more in Illinois and two more in California. But I've decided against showing thosebecause those scammers are being monitoredas part of ongoing investigations. In fact, over the past four months, Jim, Pierogi, and I have been in contact withinvestigators from the respective local police departments,  the Department of Justice, Homeland Security, and the FBI. And we've turned over to themevery last bit of evidence we've stumbled upon. So hopefully, like me, you now have a better understandingof how these scam calls operate, and here's why that matters.  The authorities are cracking down more on these guys, both here in the States and in India. But it's sort of a game of whack-a-moleand another one will just pop upbecause the financial incentives are so great. The only way to truly defeat this is by spreading awareness, thereby making it ineffective.  So if you have someone in your life who's olderthat means a lot to you, please educate them or even share this video with them. I put some resources in the video descriptionif you've been exposed to fraud, but all the experts agree, it's much better to not be reactive here, but proactive by spreading awareness and understanding what this looks like. And speaking of being proactive, I will close with some good news, which is that thanks to Jim who explains how he did itin a video he just released on his channel, We have the identifying informationof the folks over in India who scammed our girl Phyllis.  And by the way, everyone in India hates these guys too. And so over the next year, of course, working with the proper authorities, we'll be executing a multi-phase operation that will be, as always, relatively harmless.  I don't wanna give too much away, but we already have some informants working for usin some of these call centers, And the first phase might include a door handleand actual poop from Phyllis's actual dog. So make sure you're subscribed, cause it's gonna be a banger.  (crashing sound)You could set your plant on this boxand it has some electronics insideto measure the soil moisture level, and then talk to you when you walk by- [Machine] Hi, I need a little water over here. That's delicious. Thank you.  - [Mark] And this machine measureshow long it's been since you've stood upand employs the kids sitting behind youon a long flight method to encourage a stretch break. This is a game to motivate exercise during a lockdown, and this is a secret safefor your most valuable possessions.  And finally, this is a g-dang Lunchables assembly line. Are you kidding me?   (toaster dings)And what do all of those have in common?   They were created by people who took my month-longcreative engineering course. I just launched this class for the first timea few months ago, and it was so freaking rewarding to see what everybody learned and created as a result. (horror sound effect). . . For the most part. And because we got so much overwhelmingly positive feedbackon the course, we're doing it again.  You could sign up for it now. This class covers my full engineering design process, all the way from how I come up with an idea to prototyping, to finalizing the build and giving it character. I show you everything that I'm thinking, everything that I'm doing, and I do it three times. Over the course of a month, you're gonna watch me design and create three totally original builds, and I'm gonna guide you through finishingthree creative builds of your own. And this is an online class, so you can take it from anywhereand work it around your schedule,  but it's fully immersive and intensive. So whether you're a working professionalor you're taking the class as a family, whether you're a complete beginneror an experienced engineer, this class has been designed to meet you where you're atand then level up your skills. So go to Monthly. com/MarkRober or use the link in the video descriptionto see what other people had to say about their experienceand then enroll, and I'll see you in class. \n","- [Mark] This guy stole my package from the porch, and he's about to open it in his house. - Hello. - What he doesn't know is that this is the third generationof a new and improved custom built bait packagethat's recording him on four different phonesand just released a pound of the world's finest glitter, along with some other nasty surprises.  (pump squeaking)But to understand how we got here, we first have to go back in time a bit. (audio reversing)Because that's when this couple stole a packagefrom my porch. And even with the video footage,  the police wouldn't do anything. So I vowed to use my engineering skillsto go full \"Home Alone\" on these punks, not just to avenge my package, but as a tribute to the two million packagesthat are stolen across America every year. And because packages are taken most in December,  for the third year now, it's sort of become a Christmastime traditionfor me to do my very small partto encourage future would be porch piratesto choose a different professionin just the most fabulous way possible.  So before we see how this year's version fares in the wild, I'm gonna first walk you through all the upgradesmy buddy, Sean, and I have been incorporatinginto this box over the past year. For starters, we updated the outer casing. This time going for more of a cyber truck aesthetic.  You can sort of see the evolutionfrom year to year right here. As part of this, we created an intentional handle herein the hopes that the package thief will grab it, not realizing we took a page directlyfrom the Kevin McAllister Home Security Planby putting extra sticky glue on the underside.  This is the exact same stuff used in those rodent traps. And as you can see here, it's incredibly strong. You'll also notice these two protruding rods. Those are the most critical improvement from last year, but more on that in a second.  Under the hood, we made quite a few changes as well. The fundamentals are still the same, where you havea battery powered Arduino-based microcontrolleron a custom printed circuit board that gives instructionsto these four phones, which allows us to record the thief no matter which side they open it from. But this time we upgraded the brains of the box itselfto have its own SIM card too, so we can fully control all the functions of the phoneat any time, including remotely triggering soundsto be played on command.  And you'll see why that matters in just a bit. And this year you'll see not one, not two, but four canisters of fart spray. I had the personal goal this year that anyonewho opened this box would at least at some point comment on just how bad it smells. Stayed with that, I'm using the sameabsolutely wretched formulathat almost killed Macaulay Culkin last year. - (coughing) I can still smell it. (Macaulay coughing)- Along with just a touch or two of essence of actual skunk.  I'm going light on this stuffbecause it lingers much longer than the fart spray, and anything more than a couple drops just wouldn't be cool. Woo. And so these cans are turned by motorswhich sprays the fart spray, and we keep spraying it every 30 seconds,  because first of all, it's ridiculous and hilarious. But second and more importantly, so they get ridof the package out of their housebefore they realize there's four phones inside. This design feature makes it so we pretty much recover our boxes 100% of the timefrom the closest trash can or dumpster, since we already know the location of the boxat all times due to the GPS tracking on the phones. But if the box does get destroyedby a package-stealing glitter-hater, (bell dinging) all the phones will have already uploaded their footageto the cloud for me to see exactly what happened. And then of course, (motor whirring)we've got the main attraction which is this spinning cuppowered by a motor underneath here, which this year holds 15% moreof the finest biodegradable glitter that money can buy.  And so then after opening the box, and just like sittingin a daze trying to process what the heck just happened, well that's when we start the countdown. - [Robotic Voice] Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, - And of course, we know four, three, two, one. nothing happens when it getsto the end. But having just been covered in glitter and fart spray, they're going to be terrifiedof what this would possibly escalate to next, by the time the countdown ends. And then after the countdown, we have the police scanner.  (walkie talkie squeaking) (static buzzing)But this year we added LEDs, so it will light up the roomin red and blue lights for added ambiance. This also allows us to illuminate the package thief's facewith white light, in case they open it in a darker setting. And then finally, we've got this lid which still has these two holes with one-way film, so we can record what's going on even before it's opened. As you can see, Kevin's older brother, Buzz, has also been working hard this year. He's releasing not just the fictitious BuzzBuds, but the entire BuzzCollection.  And it's just adorable when you hearsome of these package thieves repeat that in excitement. And this is literally the box we use, but somehow they never bother to read the sidewith lots of little wordsthat would totally give the whole thing away. And so now with the lid in place,  you could see the function of those two rods from earlier, because when the lid slides off, they shoot out, which prevents the natural reaction of someonewho just quickly put the lid right back on again. This happened quite a bit last year, and it just makes it way less fun for nearly everyone involved. And if you look at the CAD, you can see how these are designedsuch that once the plunger is extended outby this spring, this little floating chunk of steeldrops down into the groove which stops the plungerfrom being pushed back in.  This is just a beautiful passive solution, and the only way to reset them to get the lid back onis to either wave a magnet here, which sucks that steel chunk up, thereby allowing the plunger to go back inor to turn the whole thing upside down which means the chunk falls out of the groovedue to gravity. And for the final major design improvement, last year it was a hassle for our porch volunteersto have to bring the boxes in and charge them every night, and then remember to put them out the next day.  It was also a problem if the box got stolenin the late afternoon, because the phone in the boxbatteries could be pretty low at that point. So this year we made a custom doormatthat discreetly plugs in, and then inductively charges the box at all times.  So it's always ready to go. So the idea is after the bad guy properly disguises himselfand then comes sneaking by and steals it off the porch, all the batteries are at a hundred percent chargeand the box knows that it's no longer on the mat.  So it texts us that it's been stolen, and starts recording and uploading footage, and sending us GPS updates. So when they eventually get home and take off the lid, the circuit board brain knows it's go-timeand autonomously sets everything in motion.  - [Robotic Voice] Hello. (fan whirring)- Now, is it petty to dedicate an entire year of your lifeto completely over-engineering a boxjust to shoot a little glitter at someone?   Yes. But at the same time, could that creation still be just ridiculous and beautiful?   Also yes. (majestic music) So that's glitter Bomb 3. 0, and if you think this is cool and you wanna support more efforts like this, you can get this super dope hoodieof the wire frame CAD model at markrover. com. After 10 years of YouTubing, I finally got some merch along with a cool new logo. And I can assure you that the money that was clearly saved by using the second rate T-shirt model just went straightinto making everything in the store super softand comfortable and to give free returns. And so now all that was left to do was to send these boxesto porches all across America.  And thanks to my friends at SimpliSafe who hooked us upwith a bunch of cameras, we could monitor everything remotely and then just wait. And we didn't have to wait long. (suspenseful music) Our very first box was taken at night. (metal clashing)- [Robotic Voice] Hello. (box tumbling)- [Movie Gangster] Keep the change, ya filthy animal.  - [Mark] And apparently they didn't seem to appreciatethe name calling or the quality engineering, (box falling)because in the morning this is what we found. So it was one box down, but we still had six backups left.  (test pattern beeping)- [Movie Gangster] Say hello, (fan whirring)to my little friend. (pump squeaking)(box hitting microphone) (pump squeaking)- [Robotic Voice] 15, 14, 13, 12, 11.ten, nine, eight, seven, six,  - [Mark] And while he didn't explicitly mention the smell, - [Robotic Voice] Five, four, three, two, one. - [Mark] The countdown was certainly pulling its own weight. (box hitting microphone)- [Movie Gangster] Say hello, (fan whirring) to my little friend. (pump squeaking)- [Box Thief] Darn (beep) bull (beep).  (pump squeaking)- [Robotic Voice] Six, five, four, three, two, one. Activation complete.  Recovery sequence initiated. (pump squeaking)- After a nice fart spray block with her hands, this lady tries to wrestle the lid on in her sinkfor a solid ten minutes and eventually exploitsour one Achilles' heel and turns it upside down.  (pump squeaking)And she got it. I mean, I'm not even mad. That's just impressive. (test pattern beeping)(box scraping microphone)- [Macaulay] Hello. (fan whirring)You guys give up?    Or are you thirsty for more?   - [Box Thief] So bright. (Box Thief laughing) (pump squeaking)- [Mark] And at this point I'm like, how is nobody mentioning the smell?   So you can imagine how happy I was to see this. - [Robotic Voice] Six, five, four,  three, two. Recovery sequence initiated. (pump squeaking)(Box Thief chuckling) (pump squeaking) (test pattern beeping)- [Macaulay] Hello. (fan whirring)You guys give up, or are you thirsty for more?   (dog barking)(pump squeaking)- [Box Thief] Ew, I smell it.  - [Mark] This one was another W for Team Fart Spray. (pump squeaking)(test pattern beeping)- [Box Thief] It looks like earplugs. - [Box Thief's Partner] Yeah, it's a whole collection. (hand hitting microphone)It's all yours now, baby. (box scraping microphone) - [Macaulay] Hello. (fan whirring)- [Movie Gangster] Keep the change, ya filthy animal. (pump squeaking)  (pump squeaking)- [Robotic Voice] 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, ten, nine, eight, seven, - Damn.  six, five, four, three, two, one. Activation complete. Recovery sequence. (pump squeaking)(static buzzing) - Dude, take it out. - [Mark] And this one was the perfect Harry and Marv Wet Bandit reaction, because not only did his room get dusted with glitter, but he got doused with the fart sprayand then freaked out with the countdown and then grabbed itby the mouse-glue handle on the way to the dumpster. (police scanner crackling) - Yes. (test pattern beeping)- These guys had suspicions, so they took it outside to open it. - [Macaulay] Hello. (fan whirring)- [Box Thief] What the?   (engine whirring)- [Macaulay] You guys give up, or are you thirsty for more?    - [Box Thief] (laughing) Wait, hold on. (pump squeaking)(box thief laughing)(laughing) I'm sorry. Hold on, we just opened the package and it was, (Box Thief laughing) glitter and fart spray. - [Box Thief's Partner] I told you. (Box Thief laughing)Get the (beep) away from it. - [Box Thief] I was so (beep). (Box Thief laughing)(pump squeaking) - [Box Thief's Partner] Oh, that (beep) stinks. Ugh. - [Voice On Scanner] 10-4, (indistinct scanner chatter)(test pattern beeping)- Because I don't want anyone to feel totally depressedabout humanity after seeing only the bad applesthat make it into my video. Just like last year, we set up a way to showcase the good apples too. So in some cases we left it by an apartment mailboxand left tons of contact information all over the label, and 90% of the people did the right thing and just walked byand didn't take something that didn't belong to them.  Then an additional 7% took it, but they were really trying to do the right thingby locating where it was supposed to go, and then calling the number that was listedall over the label. - [Voice On Phone] And they left them outby the group mailbox. - Really?   - [Voice On Phone] Yeah, I'm just like,  I do not wanna leave these there. - In those cases, we would go retrieve the box from themand typically give them a couple hundred bucksfor being so cool. It's only that teensie remaining 3% that get to starin my video, and they almost never fitmy preconceived notion of what a package thief is.  Like in this case, we had placed it by this mailbox, and then randomly a bunch of police showed upto arrest this guy who lived there. Then this teenage kid comes out and grabs the boxliterally walking past several police officersin the process.  - [Teen] We're gonna steal a package in front of the cops?   - [Another Teen] Nobody saw you, dude. - [Teen] You promise?   - [Another Teen] And they're not even paying attentionto that. They've come to take care of that other guy. You gotta get rid of this stuff. (tape tearing) I need to cut this up and get rid of it. Here, we're gonna actually flush this down the toilet. - [Teen] So no one can find it?   - [Another Teen] Yep. - [Teen] It feels good. - [Another Teen] What feels good?   - [Teen] Stealing. - [Another Teen] Stop.  Don't brag about it. Nothing. - [Teen] Okay. - [Another Teen] 'Cause you know the kid, he would've taken it. - [Teen] Any one of them would have. Could I have the buds?   - [Another Teen] We'll talk. This is my Christmas present. (box scraping microphone) - [Movie Gangster] Merry Christmas, (fan whirring)- [Teen] Whoa. - [Movie Gangster] Ya filthy animal. (pump squeaking) - [Teen] Ew, fart spray. - [Another Teen] Go get a garbage bag. (pump squeaking)- [Robotic Voice] 15, 14, 13, 12, 11,  ten, nine. (garbage bag crinkling)- [Voice On Scanner] 10-4, I've got a readon the location. - [Another Teen] Well, it was a joke. It was a glitter bomb. - [Teen] So we won't get in trouble for stealing?   (scanner screeching) - I'm hopeful the fart spray changedhis thoughts on stealing. And as we were in the process of puttingall these boxes out, I kept getting spammedwith all those prerecorded scam calls. So I thought, how amazing would it beif I could send a glitter bomb to one of those guys?    So I called up my buddy, Jim Browning, who has a YouTube channel dedicated to reversingthe remote connection on scammers computers, in this case getting access to their CCTV footage, then disrupting the scam by warning the victimand/or their bank. And so by teaming up, we were able to physically intercept two packages that were moments away from being deliveredto scammers, and then swap them out for glitter bombs. - [Delivery Person] Have a good holiday. - And these packages contained more than $10000 in cashthat we were able to return to their at first very confused,  but then very grateful owners. And it's such a crazy, convoluted storythat involves multiple continents, private investigators, the NYPD. - [Scammer] It's a glitter bomb. It has a camera built into it.  There's a camera built into this. - But the problem is, it's like we rolled over this logand all sorts of interesting stuff came crawling out. So we're still chasing down leads, and basically glitter bombing our waythrough the whole chain of command.  And don't worry, we're being cautious, and we're appropriately working with the authorities. At any rate, I was planning on putting all thatin this video, but the whole situation has takensuch a hard right and is still ongoingthat I won't be ready to tell the full storyfor another couple months.  And by the way, if you're thinking, \"How dumb could someone be?   I would never send $15000 in cash through the mail. \"Just hold your judgment 'til you hear the full story. The scammers tactics have evolved way beyondjust an email from a Nigerian prince.  So make sure you're subscribed to my channeland Jim's channel if you want to hearhow this whole thing pans out. Another new thing we tried this year, was because I live near San Franciscoand cars get broken into all the time up there, I was curious what would happen if we put one in a car seat.  And the window was busted literally within an hour. We actually had a camera placed in the carand one across the street, but apparentlyMurphy's law was in full force that day'cause the one in the car suddenly got corruptedand stopped recording. (static buzzing) And then I'm sure the world's nicest, but unfortunately also the slowest Uber patron, got picked up at precisely the worst possible moment. The whole thing took like five seconds totalfor them to smash the window, grab the box, and just be gone.  (box scraping microphone)- [Box Thief] I don't know what this is. Brand new though. - [Mark] My buddies in the field followed them for a bitin case they were just gonna toss it out the windowuntil we heard this. - [Box Thief] They're following us. - [Box Thief's Partner] The the PD's coming.  That's why we left, clown. - [Box Thief] That's why I was moving quick, 'cause the PD was coming. - [Box Thief's Partner] I got a gun in the car at all timesdriving around the city. - [Mark] At that point we decided to stay putand just watch the GPSas they drove all around the city streetsfor about two hours. And look, besides my theft, I'm not gonna make any other accusations about them. I mean, maybe they're just a group of buddieswho love to cruise around together for a couple hoursand admire all sorts of different cars. - [Box Thief's Partner] There's a rental behind us, a four-door behind us.  - [Box Thief] I see a Tesla that's got bling. - [Box Thief's Partner] Silver Acura right here. - [Box Thief] Stop, get 'em. - [Mark] But there's another explanation entirelythat also fits the GPS evidence. - [Box Thief] I really got to use the bathroom.  - They're just trying to find a bathroom. - [Box Thief's Partner] Is a restroom there?   There's a restroom at Shell?   (comical music)They don't got a bathroom there. (comical music) Is the restroom there?   - [Box Thief] COVID, man, they ain't letting nobody in. (comical music)- [Box Thief's Partner] There's no restrooms nowhere, bro. You better go do the squat up with these baby wipes, man. - Either way, the batteries were almost dead on the box.  So we decided to go with the Hail Mary option. Hey guys, it's me, the headphones box. Of uploading a custom sound to the phoneto see how they would react. So we don't want any trouble. So you can go ahead and open me, and you can have everything inside.  We'll call it even. Now, I can take that audio message, and text it to the box. And then I could listen, near real time, as the clips were uploaded to the server. You can go ahead and open me, and you can have everything inside. We'll call it even.  - [Box Thief] I could bang it, I could bang-(alarm blaring)(gunshots popping)(static buzzing) (test pattern beeping)(alarm blaring) (gunshots popping) - Probably not gonna go try and get that box back. And so while I'm left contemplatingexactly what just happened, I'll leave you with my favorite reaction from this year. (test pattern beeping) - [Box Thief] I picked it up. It's (beep) brand new. Buzz boss, BuzzBuds in here and some other (beep). - [Box Thief's Partner] Can I open it?   - [Box Thief] Yeah. (Box Thief's partner laughing)(box scraping microphone)- [Macaulay] Hello.  (fan whirring)- [Movie Gangster] Keep the change, ya filthy animal. - Oh, it's one of those-(pump squeaking)(Box Thief's partner laughing)It's one of thosetrick boxes. - That was weird.  - So somebody (beep). - What came out of it?   Glitter?   - [Box Thief's Partner] Yeah. - Oh my God. What the (beep)?    (all coughing)(Box Thief laughing)It was one those (beep).  (pump squeaking)- [Robotic Voice] 15, 14, - Oh gosh. 13, 12, 11, ten, nine, eight. - All right, it's gonna blow. Seven, six, five,  four, three, two, one. (woman screaming)Activation complete. (pump squeaking)Recovery sequence initiated. - [Box Thief] I don't know what the (beep) that box, Oh, God. Disgusting.  What kind of mother (beep) would ship that?   (pump squeaking)(metal crashing)- If you look in our freezer, you'll see my ice cream. Well, kind of. You'll have to first open this bag of frozen vegetablesI camouflage it in.  But inside that bag, you'll find this cup and lidI designed. Now you might be thinking, \"Big whoop, Mark. \"But let me explain why the whoop is, in fact, very big. Because I can put my ice cream in here, and the lid just barely slides on at room temperature.  But then when you let it chill in the freezerfor a bit and take it out, the lid is clamped onto the base with 500 pounds of force, thereby protecting you from anyone elsein my house who won't realizethe trick is just to run room temperature waterover the lid for about 30 seconds.  And the reason this works is because the base is madefrom steel and the lid is made from aluminum. And aluminum shrinks more when it gets coldand grows more when it warms up. This idea just occurred to me one day, so I made it.  And that's the thing I love about being an engineer. If you have an idea about a thingand that thing doesn't exist, you can just will it into existence. So here's my big announcement. I've been secretly working for nearly a yearon a month-long creative engineering course that will teach you how to use engineering and scienceto bring your own creative ideas to life. In this class, I cover my full engineering design processfrom how I come up with the ideas, to prototyping, to finalizing the build and giving it character.  I talk through everything that I'm thinking, everything that I'm doing, and I do it three times. Over the course of a month, you'll watch me designand create three totally original builds, but more importantly, I will guide you through finishing three creative builds of your own. And this is an online class, so you could take itfrom anywhere and work it around your schedule, but it's fully immersive and intensive. So whether you're a complete beginneror an experienced engineer,  this course has been designed to meet youwhere you're at, and then level up your skills. And the engineering process I will teach youis the exact same one I used at NASA, and at Apple, and for all of my videos. Just go to monthly. com/markrober or use the link in the video descriptionto check it out and then enrollin this month-long learning experience with me. \n","- This is a specialized human-shaped shark cage I designed. And this is me in the middle of a shark feeding frenzyin that cage, which as it happens, doesn't actually keep the sharks out.  They're in the freaking cage. But to understand how I ended upin the middle of The Bahamas with buckets of blood, surrounded by a butt ton of sharks,  we've gotta go back exactly one year. Because that's when I ran a test to see what really happensif sharks smell a drop of human blood in the water. For that experiment,  I pumped out 15 drops of human blood per minute for an hour, pretty close to a bunch of sharks that in the endjust weren't really that interested. So this busted the myth from the movies that sharks are these ruthless killers that just go crazyif they smell a drop of your blood from a mile away. But those results made me really curious if the sharkswould react differently to fish blood versus human blood.  And if they did go crazy for fish blood, could I use that to put myself right at the centerof a shark feeding frenzy?   And so to satiate my curiosity, my friends at Discovery helped me make my way back to The Bahamas as part of Shark Week this year. But this time, I wouldn't be alone. - What up, Robes?   - Oh wow. Mark's jumping in on this?   - What's up, y'all?    - Look, last Shark Week, shark tried to kill me. - Hmm?   - I figure we'd have a little bit of science with Rober, a little bit of fun with Dude Perfect,  and a little bit of me. All right, y'all ready to do this?   - We were born ready, sir. - All right. (palms smacking) Chop chop. Let's get to it, fellas. - We will not let you down.  Looking forward to it. See ya later. - See ya. - Yeah, I've got this idea for a buildto just really get me in close with the sharks. Last year- - Hey, Rober. - I was in the water.  - Rober. Rober. - Hmm?   - That was me saying I'm finished with the call, bro. - No, of course. - All right, see you guys later. Let's get to it. - Let's do this. - Looking forward to it. See ya.  - And so in the direction of Shaq Diesel, it was time to head to The Bahamas. All that was left was to swab my noseto prove to the Bahamian governmentthat I didn't have coronavirus. The only problem was my test came back positive.  And this just made me really sadbecause not only was I gonna miss outon this epic adventure, but as far as I was concerned, I was basically just waiting to die.  And I had to interact with my family through the glass doorto the backyard using a laser pointer and not evenFat Gus would get within six feet of me.  Now, I'm happy to say I eventually beat the RONAand tested negative, but the only problem nowis I missed my chance because they were no longeraccepting any commercial flights from America 'cause we're number one baby. So I was once again incredibly sad until I found a loophole. Because while you couldn't go to The Bahamason a public commercial flight,  there were no rules against going to The Bahamason a private jet. And since this was the first and last timeI would ever have my own personal G6,  I acted like I'd been here before, like the true professional I am. I mean, mostly. (bright upbeat music)   Put Elon on hold and transfer to Oprah. (bright upbeat music) I should mention, flying across country on your own planeisn't the most ecologically responsible choice.  So while I was in the air, I utilized this website called teamtrees. org. You might have heard of it. To plant enough trees to suck up the carbonnot only for my flight, but the next 100 flights this plane would take.  (bright upbeat music)In the end, it's important you guys knowI'm still super groundedand I didn't let the experience change me one bit.  And so now that I was in The Bahamas, the first thing I did was check in with my marine biologist, shark diving expert buddy Luke Tipple, because we need to figure out how to somehow get blood out of a fish. Oh. (giggles)- [Luke] Just like that. - This is how we do it?   The first thought is like, (fish thuds) can you just freaking blend a fish?   - Give it a shot. I'll be over here. - Dude, you've clearly never seen \"Will It Blend?   \". There's a whole YouTube channel dedicated to this. Ready?    (blender whirs)Oh! (both laughing) (blender whirring)Okay. I think if we add a little bit of water. Yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.  (both groans)This looks like the number 32 from Jamba Juice. We tried a variety of other techniquesand eventually started hitting our stride and the bucket started filling up. (bright upbeat music)  If I couldn't smell this, that looks pretty delicious. (bright upbeat music)- The good thing about Mark is it's his stupid idea, but he is not making other people do it. - I respect that about me too.  - Yeah. (bright upbeat music)I also learned this is what fish gills look like on the inside. They're like pages in a book to increase the surface areawhich maximizes the oxygen they can pull outta the water. So we've taken about 20 fish with a little bit of help from the blender, turned them into this. If I'm a shark, I'm like, that's freaking delicious. Now that we had five gallonsof mouthwatering fish blood smoothie,  it was time to get some answers. We already know that sharks don't necessarily go nutsin the presence of a little bit of human blood, but would they go nuts in the presence of a little bit of fish blood?   And as a firm believer in the scientific method, it was time to test our hypothesis by heading out to sea. Once we were far enough from land, Luke and I came up with a game plan for the experiment.  Basically we would have two surfboards in the water. One would have a five gallon bucketof our fish blood smoothie, and then another would have five gallons of human blood. We would also have a third board that just had seawater as a control to make sure the sharksweren't just interested in the surfboards. Then we would pump out the contentsof each of the buckets over the course of an hourand observe how many sharks approached each board.  Then, once we know which one they prefer after this, we'll use that tomorrow in the cage, just to create the most wild feeding frenzy, right?   - Which sounds super fun to me. - 'Cause you're not in the cage.  (both laughs)And so with the plan in place, all that was left to do was put the boards together, and get them out with the sharks. (bright upbeat music)   One of the limitations to last year's testwas that the boards might have been too close to the boat. So it's possible some of the sharksactually smelled the blood but didn't investigate it because they were just waiting for a handout from the boat. So this time we basically placed the boardsin the middle of the fricking oceansuper far away from the boat, so it wouldn't be a confounding variable.  Oh, and I should also mention we ended upusing cow's blood because it's really hardto legally find five gallons of human blood. And after talking with a couple shark scientiststhey've shown experimentally that all mammal blood essentially smells the same to sharks. So, it wouldn't affect the results to use cow bloodin place of human blood. So, now that all three boards were in place,  we double checked to ensure each was anchored downto the ocean floor. Then I just had to start all three custom-built pumpsusing our custom-built remote trigger, which is the exact moment I realized it must have got busted while being shipped out herebecause it wasn't sending a signal. Which sucks because there's absolutely no wayto run the pumps manually.  Luckily, a trick I learned while working at NASAis you always build redundancy into your systemsjust in case. So we have it in the code that if no remote start signal is received after an hour, each of the pumpswill just automatically start up on their own. It's just a feature we never had time to test, so we just had to firmly cross our fingers and hope for the best. I'm hopeful. We've had to overcome a lot to get here for this video. What's one more little challenge. And at exactly one hour,  right on cue, the backup code kicked inand saved our whole experiment. With blood now officially in the water, we put the drone into the air and started our observations.  (bright upbeat music)And things were pretty quiet for about the first 20 minutes, but then we had our first hit on the mammal blood board.  Shark?    - Yeah. - Shark, baby!We got a shark! - It's a shark?   Oh yeah, yeah. - But pretty soon thereafter, things started heating upfor the fish blood smoothie board. Oh my gosh.  There's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 sharksaround the fish smoothie board. And then 10 minutes later, things were only more intense.  Here you can see the difference in activitybetween the three boards. And while you're running an experimentand still collecting data, you really need to keep an open mind.  But given what we were seeing, it was getting pretty difficult to remain objective. And so after an hour, we called the experimentand went inside to officially tally up the results using the drone footage. And it turns out the mammal blood boardwas approached eight times. The seawater control board was at zero. And the fish blood board had a whopping 134 approaches from a shark. Definitely seems like the fish smoothieis where it's at, right?   - It was pretty obvious. - Massive blob of sharks. No sharks.  - I think that's the go for tomorrowfor maximum feeding frenzy. Now that we had a game planfor my feeding frenzy cage the next day, we headed back to shore and to our hotelto get some rest for what was to come.  Oh and fun side note, if the only wayto get to a vacation destination is by private jet, it really cuts down on the crowds. (bright upbeat music) We literally had this whole resort to ourselves. Well, almost to ourselves. There were like 40 catswho apparently must also fly private.  We woke up bright and early the next morning, feeling refreshed and headed right back out to seawhere Luke and I prepared some massive bagsof fish blood smoothie for me to burst open once I went down. It just seemed like a cool idea to make a cageto get in the middle of a feeding frenzy, until this moment. (laughs dryly)Now that they're making me put on freaking chainmail,  makes me reconsider my life choices. If something terrible happens, Shaq you gotta take care of my familybecause this is all your fault. - Yeah. Let's go.  - And after several months of prep, unfortunately, it was time for me to get in.  It also just so happens, I might have forgot to mention this part to my wife. I'm not looking under the water yet on purpose.  She might have been under the impressionI was just doing another experimentwith surfboards and pumps. Sorry, sweetie. Not only was I wearing 10 pounds of steel chainmail for protection, but my vest is also filled with 20 pounds of lead weights. That means I sank pretty fast. But also that the buoyancy to weight ratios were perfect for giving me practice for walking on the moon. That's one small step for man. Because like many of you, I will definitely go to space in my lifetime.  Again, just haven't mentioned that to the wife yet. Super Mario jump, here we go. (water sloshing) Let's do this baby!- [Luke] All right, you ready for the top?   (gentle upbeat music)Okay Mark, the bait is coming behind you right now.  (gentle upbeat music)(water sloshing)- Now that I have the fish smoothie bagsand everyone was back at a safe distance,  I decide to pop these stupid things. Okay. Here I go. Oh, this is crazy. What am I doing?    (suspenseful music)Okay, the bait is deployed. Ah! I got to get this stuff outta here. Here they come. (Mark screams)Oh.  Oh my God. Oh God, they're bumping the cage.  (suspenseful music intensifies)Look at those teeth!That could have been my handif I wasn't doing the T-Rex maneuver.  They want to eat me real bad. Oh, now they're literally like moving circles around me. Oh gosh.  Oh! His head's in the cage!What the crap!This is certifiably insane!Oh!The sharks were literally trying to eat me through the bottom of the cage. So, they left me no choice but to defend my honor. Yeah, get outta my cage!Get outta my cage! I'm gonna kill you Shaq!Get the heck out!Ayyyy. Awwww.  Yo bro, get outta my cage, all right?   They loved our blended concoction. We knew all along that the most dangerous partwould be when I exited the cage because they'd still be agitatedand they'd be stoked to finally have accessto the soft chewy center. Okay, the blood kinda dissipated. The sharks have gone a little bit.  - [Luke] Okay, we're pulling the bait away, mate. - [Mark] So the plan was for one of the other diversto distract them way off to the side with a bait box, and then I would get out as silently as possible so they wouldn't notice me. Dude, that was insane.  Yeah, you're not so tough now, are you sharks?   - [Luke] Okay Mark, go ahead, open the door. - Okay. (breathing noises)  Oh crap. (contraption thuds loudly)That was loud. (water sloshing)Dude. Luke! Holy crap. I've gotta close this back up. (suspenseful music) Oh geez. Luke, I need help, man. Holy crap. Geez. - [Luke] Keep your arms in mate. These sharks aren't going away. I'm going to get you back to the surface.  - [Mark] Okay. (screams)Oh my gosh. (water sloshing) - [Luke] Top side, top side. We're on our way out. - [Mark] I think somewhere to tell Shaqhe can do his own stunts from now on. Hey! I'm alive! The main takeaway for me for this experienceis that sharks have been on this planetlonger than the dinosaurs or even trees have. So, they've had 400 million years of evolution to develop these instincts that are rewardedfor smelling fish blood. Humans and cows will be an extremely rare delicacy. So it makes sense that it's not just hardwiredinto their brains.  And so with all my limbs intactand with my curiosity fully satiated, I will leave you with these profound wordsthat in my defense might have been the drama in me speaking. As humans we're always the predator and not really ever the prey. But this gave me a senseof what it's like to be a tuna fish. (heavy drum beat)(playful upbeat music)  \n","- This is a bird feeder, and everything to my left is my attemptat making it squirrel-proof. If they want the bird seed, they will first need to pass through what is basicallyan eight-part \"Ninja Warrior\" obstacle course for squirrels. This course is extremely challenging.  It is not for the timid of heart. But out of the gate, I will admit that in hindsightthat I completely underestimated my adversary. Now if you're wondering why I would gothrough all this trouble, we need to go back eight weeks ago when I found myself stuck at home and very bored. So I installed a bird feederand decided to become a birdwatcher, and it was just so lovely (birds chirping)(record scratches) until they showed up.  Now, luckily, my bird feeder had a wire cage around it, big enough for the birds to slip insidebut small enough to prevent the squirrelsfrom getting the food, and that worked really well until right here. For me, this was like the moment in \"Jurassic Park\" when they realized the Velociraptors can open door handles. And once the door was open, it was clear this wasn't their first rodeo. They basically cleared this whole tube of bird seedby the end of the day.  Mind you, this bird feeder was advertisedas being squirrel-proof. So I bought another squirrel-proof bird feederto replace it. It's got this outer cage suspended by some springs, and so if a bird comes and lands here, it doesn't weigh that much and it has access to the seeds. However, if a squirrel comes, they'll grab onto this cage. Its weight will force the springs down, thereby preventing access to the seeds. I have no ideahow the squirrels could possibly outsmart this,  but let's see. And this one work exactly as intended. You can see the birds love it, but when the squirrel comes along, the cage shifts downand now all the seed ports are covered up.  Every time they tried, it was the same results. However, the next morning, this guy manages to unclip the springsthat hold the cage up, which means the cage stays in the lowered positionwhere it blocks all the seed openings. Problem with that is now they can get to the lid.  But this bird feeder lid doesn't hinge opento give direct access, so he goes with a different tactic, (bird feeder clanking)(birds chirping)where he now has access to all the bird seed he wants.  And so I decided I would try one more bird feeder design. Okay. Wow. It almost feels intentional at this point. This one's supposed to work wellbecause it's got this baffle, which is supposed to keep the squirrels from just coming straight down and getting to the seeds, and more importantly, there's no way for them to rip this off. We'll see. This one debuted to similar results. As he hangs by a few toes,  this is when I really started to gain an appreciationfor what they were capable of. It definitely seemed like this bird feederwas their favorite. Okay, yeah, they're flexing on me for sure. And at this point, a plan was forming in my head,  but just to be thorough, I moved the post away from the fence. And I can't say I was surprised when they just climbed it, nor was I surprised to see they could shimmy upand down a small metal poleor even a large one for that matter. And whether they could climb a certain pole material was a moot point anyways because of this!Look at this!These guys are basically freaking rodent-sized Simone Biles!And on some level, this is what it felt like when someone stole a packagefrom my porch that didn't belong to them,  and I harnessed that indignation, spending a year designing the glitter bomb bait package. - Hello. (glitter bomb whirring)- [Mark] Complete with special fragrances. - Aw. - If I could design a package to deter thieves,  could I design a bird feeder to deter squirrels?   And so after a couple weeks of brainstorming, designing, and building with my buddy John, we put it all together in this 20-second build montage.  (upbeat music) (tools whirring)(aerosol can hissing)(metal clanking)(drill whirring) Here are the basic elements. For starters, here's where I've placed their favorite bird feeder, at the end of the course. And to sweeten the deal,  right below that, there's a trapdoor. And if they step here, it releases a butt-ton of walnutsand unfurls some celebratory banners. Why walnuts?    I'm glad you asked.  I'm using walnuts because over the course of a week, I put out a buffet of seven different nuts and seeds. And all four times I repeated the experiment, walnuts were always the one they ate first. What's great about placing this hereis it levels the playing field as the birds can fly up and get as much food as they want anytime they need it. The squirrels, however, will have to work for itbecause the only way to make it to this platformis if they work their waythrough my eight-part \"Ninja Warrior\" obstacle course,  which all starts right here. This is the only platform on the coursethat has a pole that isn't covered in slippery stuff, which means this is where they have to climb upto enter the course. If they try and get up any other way,  they can't keep a good gripand they just slide back down. So the first challenge is the Bridge of Instability. Now, this may look easy, but the trick is it attaches at a single point on each end. And from a physics standpoint, that makes it no different than trying to crawl across a tightrope. It's the same deceptive principlewith that one carnival game that's so impossible. I broke it down in another video where I use physicsto show which carnival games were basically scamsand the science on how to beat them.  Next up, the Maze of a Thousand Corridors. This one's a bit more cerebral, but if they make it through that, it will bring 'em to the Pitchfork Tumblers, which are inspired by the show \"Wipe Out. \"But unlike \"Wipe Out, \"I should point outthat all these contraptions are squirrel-friendly,  and even with a little back force, they will break away and stop spinning. Now, if they can make itpast the Pitchfork Tumblers of Treachery, they come to one of my personal favorites, the Homewrecker. (romantic music) I put her in to tempt the squirrel to lose focuson the real prize at the end of the course. Because this pad has a pressure sensor underneath itand it connects to a microcontroller that has a relay that connects to a solenoidthat connects to a pneumatic pistonthat connects back to this platformwith the pressure sensor, and so if they stand here for more than three seconds, they've gotta start the course all over again.  Next up is the Slinky Bridge of Deception. I've suspended a juicy walnut right in the middle, but there's no way this bridge will support their weight. So it'll be interesting to see how they approach it. The sixth challenge is called the Tourist Trap.  It's actually a bit of a reward for making it this far. If the squirrel sticks their headthrough this board my wife painted, it's just a photo op they can hang on the wallof their tiny squirrel nest. I'll place a walnut here as an incentivefor them not to miss this unique opportunity.  The penultimate challengeare the Quad Steps of Great Elevation. This is taken straight from \"Ninja Warrior, \"and this is super trickybecause these pads are all totally smoothand placed at a 45-degree incline. And now for the last challenge.  At this point, they are a near few feet away from their ultimate goal. But if they're not careful, they'll have to deal with the Orbital Assist Platform, aka the Final Countdown, aka \"It's not a catapult, it's a squirrel-pult, \" which means they now have to go backand start all the way over from the beginning. Now, if they wanna avoid that fate, they just need to stand on this padfor less than three seconds.  But once again, I've placed a diversion here. This one projects an optical illusionof anything you place in the bottom of this dish. It's actually super trippyand looks even more impressive in real lifebecause the projected image is 3D. They're like nine bucks on Amazon,  and I put a link that explains the juicy physicsof how they work in the video description. Now with regards to squirrel safety, I know I seem to have this reputation of(fire sizzling)(glass shattering)(people screaming) improvised high-speed projectiles, and so this one might worry a few animal lovers out there, including my wife. We have five pets and one child, and the child was the only one I had a say in. So rest assured, I can adjust the pressure on the piston,  and we'll be staying way below any launch forcethat could hurt any of our adorable backyard contestants. And so, finally, after making it through all that, we're back here at the world's most satisfying bird feeder.  And as far as I'm concerned, if they make it here, they've earned the right to gorge next to the birdsfor as long as they want. And so after nearly a month of prep work, the course was officially open for business. (lighthearted music) They could smell the walnuts at the final station, and you could see the gears turningbecause right above that was their favorite bird feeder. And so before long, we had our first contender.  (bright electronic music) That didn't exactly go as planned, so Rick decides to regroup. Speaking of which, that's Rick. There are a total of four competitors that will be attempting the course. First up is Rick, and he weighs 500 grams. I know this 'cause he's actually standingon a custom-made scale. Rick is very clever as you'll see here in a minute, but he also gets spooked easily.  Next up is Marty. He's basically indistinguishable from Rick. Rick and Marty are inseparableand pretty much spend all their time together as a pair. Our third contender is Frank, also coming in around 500 grams. He's very gutsy. He's also kinda dumb.  Finally, we've got my personal favorite, Phat Gus. He's just really charmingand will strike a pose if he sees a camera. He also really likes to eat, and he tips the scales at an impressive 800 grams.  While most of the squirrels are kind of particularbefore making a selectionand then gracefully leaping away, Phat Gus just goes for it, hands-free, just makes himself real comfortable. Here he is laying out with a light snack from the bird feeder. I mean, you can't fault the guyfor just clearly appreciating a good meal. So now that you know our four contenders, let's get back to Rick. So he hops back on, and he's actually doing better than his first attempt.  Mm, just barely. This is the best because he's like, \"Okay, I got this. Nevermind. Well, maybe I, no, I definitely don't. \"And this was the exact moment I realizedI just might be outmatched here.  (playful music)Marty was watching Rickand, after a quick dip of his toes in the water, adopts his strategy right out of the gate.  Ooh, so close, but an excellent recovery. And Phat Gus, perhaps predictably, comes up a little short, which brings us to the Maze of a Thousand Corridors, which, to be honest, they mastered this one pretty quickly.  Here's a solid run from Phat Gus. And now for the Pitchfork Tumblers of Treachery. Marty was like, \"Yeah, that's a hard pass. \"Phat Gus is just like, \"Abort!\" Frank is just like, \"Nope. \"Then he's like, \"Wait a second. Mm, still nope. \"Then Marty flies in real hot over the top. He didn't make it through, but that's partial credit as far as I'm concerned.  And then here's Phat Gus with my favorite attempt by far. (bright music)And then Frank shows no fear, which helps him pull up this near-flawless run.  And finally, Smart Rick surgically weaves his way throughessentially untouched. And I should mention, the squirrels were most active from 6:00 to 10:00 AM, so every morning I've been getting up before the sunriseto start filming from in my house,  like one of those camouflage nature photographers, only like a suburbanized version. I've also had a handful of streaming cameras rolling 24/7, which has allowed me to make such discoveriesas we have the world's worst guard dog.  Thanks for the help, pal. Now back to the Homewrecker. You could see Rick is instinctively suspiciousof this gold diggerand only for a brief moment puts his full weighton the platform. I told you he was smart. His buddy Marty, on the other hand. . .  She is a cruel mistress. And because I know my wife is going to ask me,  no, this will not hurt the squirrel for two reasons. Number one, they are amazing like catsand always land on their feet. And two, they themselves were jumpingfrom this height all the time, and in some cases, much higher.  In fact, squirrels are one of the few mammalsthat can survive a fall from any heightbecause they make their terminal velocity so low. You can see it right here. They make their body as flat as possible, then put their tail back to increase drag.  They basically become their own parachute. And then right before they land, they pull in and fully extend their arms and legsto act as shock absorbing landing gear. This is so cool. Now back to the coursewhere even Smart Rick eventually lets his guard down,  which is exactly when she strikes. But just like all the other obstacles so far, after a day or two, they'd mastered it.  In this case, even disregarding her offering of a fresh walnut. Now onto the Slinky Bridge of Deception, and this was the sleeper obstacle in my book. That is not a large gap, which they can easily jump,  but having the slinky there just threw them off somehow. You can see how much Frank is struggling here, and he's the brave one. And Rick only jumps when Marty shows upfor emotional support.  But like all the obstacles so far, after a day or two, they'd mastered it. Now onto our third to last obstacle, the Tourist Trap, and this one was just a freaking delight. A little peanut butter really did the trick here.  (camera shutter clicks)(playful music) Now here comes Phat Gus. And I mean, how Phat Gus is this?   He sees the camera and he's like, \"Paint me like one of your French squirrels. Yeah?    No?   No takers?    All right. \"Here's another classic Guswhere he looks at the camera, wait a second.  Play that back, (electronic whirring)and freeze. Zoom, enhance. (electronic beeping)(record scratches) (eerie music)(air whooshes) (keyboard clacking) (lighthearted music)Well, turns out Phat Gus is not a dude and he's pregnant, which meant I was suddenly feeling real uncomfortableabout all those weight comments.  So after a bit of a pivot to smooth things over, we soldiered on to the Quad Steps of Great Elevation. Frank comes in rather confident, almost to his demise, but he pulls off the smooth recovery.  So after not much time at all, they were looking pretty good here. In fact, one morning, I noticed Marty totally skipped the last step altogether, which I took as a challenge,  and so I removed the middle step to see what they would do. And who else but Phantastic Gus?   Let's slow that down a bit. They're such amazing jumpers, so I suppose the quick mastery here wasn't a surprise.  I mean, this right here is probably a 10-foot jump. And here's some classic brave but dumb Frank. He'd already entered the course normallyand made it to the Homewrecker at least a dozen timesby this point,  and yet for some reason, he decides this 12-foot jump is his best course of action. And Smart Rick was the first one to enter the course. So in the end, after about a week of effort, it was fitting he was the oneto make it to the jackpot first. And he's so stoked he apparently wants to run the whole course in reverse. In hindsight, we probably should have made the jackpot a little quieter. Here's Marty, as always, not far behind. (light music) He's also a bit flighty as you know, which worked against him here, because down below, Phantastic Gus, ever the opportunist, comes through with the real stroke of brilliance. But pretty soon, Marty comes back like,  \"Um, I'm the one who kinda earned that. \"And then Phantastic Gus is like, \"You snooze, you lose, sucker!\"And might I just say, Phantastic Gus, when you sit like that, you don't look an ounce over 700 grams. Eventually, they learned that sound was a good thing and they'd quickly return for their rewardbefore Phantastic Gus got any ideas. So here's a single camera shot of a full run. And by the end, all of them could do the full coursein less than 40 seconds. And while we're watching,  you might be wondering what happened to the squirrel-pult. Unfortunately, they didn't really fall for my illusion much, but I'm about to show you the two times they did. And as a promise to my wife, I turned the pressure to only 40% full power, so the acceleration the squirrel would feel is about half a g, which is 10 times less than a typical rollercoaster. Additionally, I never turned oneither the Homewrecker trapdoor or the launch platformwhen I wasn't actively watching from inside my housewhere I had a manual override button,  because as safe as it was, something about launching Phantastic Gusjust didn't feel right. Now what you're about to see is gonna look pretty chaotic. But when we check the slow-mo, amazingly, I'll show you how the squirrel is totally in control pretty much the whole time. All right, now here's a second angle. Also, even if you don't trust my calculations, I can assure you that the squirrels did not care.  In both launch cases, they were back up on the course in like five minutes. Here's the slow-mo, and see if you could spot the two critical things he doesto make sure he lands feet down.  Did you catch it?   The first critical moment is right here. He's already done the predictive math, and he's locked his head on the spot where he plans to land. And now his head will not lose that lock the whole way down.  What's crazy is the time it takes himto do all the predictive mathto know exactly where he will landand to lock his head is 300 milliseconds. That's exactly this long. Literally less than the blink of an eye.  That blows my mind. But if you think about it, it makes sense these reactions would've evolvedto be razor-sharpif you live your life in the treesconstantly making split-second decisions. Now, besides picking the landing spot with his head, the second trick is with his arms.  When he wants to keep his upper body from rotating, he has his arms out. But the moment he wants to rotate his upper body quickly, he tucks them in. And then when he wants to stop rotating, he extends them out again. This is straight up conservation of angular momentum.  It's the same trick ice skaters use. Basically, bring your limbs in if you want to rotate fast, extend them out if you wanna slow the rotation. My buddy Destin from Smarter Every Dayalso made a video analyzing how cats always land on their feet, and they do the exact same two tricks. The head target lockand bringing limbs in to rotateand out to stop rotation. (air whooshes) Here's the second launch. So this may look like pure luck in real time,  but the slow-mo tells a different story. In that amount of time, he's already made a slight lateral push in that directionand locked his landing target with his head. We know from the previous clip he can rotate his bodyto any orientation, but he doesn't in this case because he sees his small push has already aligned himfor the perfect landing. That's just so cool. And so after those two physics demonstrations, I disabled both the Launcher and the Homewrecker trapdoorand just let them enjoy the course in peace.  As far as I was concerned, they had earned it. Plus, after spending a month together, we were sort of bros by this point. If they saw me coming out to work, they would certainly jump away, but then they'd just quickly be right back. And sadly, all good things must come to an end.  And because I didn't want themto develop an unhealthy dependence on my handouts, after about a week of free reign, I took down the course. But in its place, I put up a specialized squirrel-sized picnic table. Every morning, this door opens to release just a few walnuts as a little treat to remind them of our good times together. Although I had to laugh that after all this, somehow I didn't anticipate on day oneFrank would immediately try and figure outand partially succeed in finding a way to beat the system. Like everything else though, they quickly caught on,  and now on some mornings, I'll catch them just waiting for the daily ration, chilling patiently on the bench seat, that is, everyone but Phantastic Gus. Don't ever change, buddy. When I started this two-month-long adventure trying to bird-watch, I had no idea I would enjoy squirrel-watching so much more. It's also made me realize that even amongst the structuresand pavement and power lines, how interesting nature can be in a single suburban backyard if you just really stop to look. Even the plants are amazing!I had no idea that as vines grow, they spin around looking for something to grab onto. I didn't anticipate the wide variety of animals that use fences as inner yard highwaysto get around as a substitute for all the trees that existedbefore we got here. Even little interactions like this spider extending his lifewith this very timely leap into the unknown were just so delightful to see. But of all the animals, I can definitively say now that squirrelsare my absolute favorite, and they're certainly a more formidable adversarythan porch pirates. They're kind of adorable,  incredibly crafty, curious by nature, athletic, and persistent. Turns out, squirrels can live to be 20 years old, and so I like to think that someday, Phantastic Gus will bring his grand-squirrels to the fence and regale them with tales of cowboys and courageand legendary walnut piles. (lighthearted music)\n","- I've always thought if we could somehowjust see the germs around us, everyone will be a lot more carefuland we'd get sick way less.  Unfortunately, that's still not possible. So I did the next best thingby running a daylong experiment in this third-grade classroom. I found this powder called Glo Germ. And just like real germs, when it's on your hands,  you can't see it. But unlike real germs, if you turn a black light on, it becomes visible.  But it transfers to things you've touched, so it provides a really good way to visualize exactly how germs spread. So before the kids arrived, as a control, I went around and noted any preexisting spots in the room that fluoresced under the black light. And then it was go time.  The kids, of course, had no idea what we were doingand that the teacher had been secretly infectedwith the glowing powder. So she randomly shook the hands of three kids but didn't touch any of the rest. And so with that, they just went about their normal day.  (lighthearted music) At break, I did choose one random student, and he agreed to letting me put some of the powder on his hands too. And then two hours later at lunchtime, I checked the results. Remember, everything you see here started with just the teacherand one student having a little of that powderon their hands. And because my flashlight can only illuminate one spot at a time, I used Photoshop to better visualize our observations of where germs were left behind, including on the other kids. Uh-oh! (children exclaiming) We're pretty hot over here!Oh, right here. And they were actually pretty diligentabout washing their hands.  This was the desk of the kid that was infected. And what's crazy is that germs could liveon a hard surface like this for up to nine days.  And so you can see how important it isto disinfect the things a sick person regularly touches.  For example, this was the phone of the teacherin the experiment.  Even if you wash your hands really often, if you immediately pull out your phone, a lot of those germs just go right back on your hands.  Think about when the last time wasthat you cleaned your phone.  My friend Joanna at \"The Wall Street Journal\"recently demonstrated you can clean your phonewith an antibacterial wipe every day for at least a year and it doesn't affect the oleophobic coating at all. And this hopefully gives you a better mental model of why it's really important to wash your handsor use hand sanitizerafter being at places like this or this or this or this.  Cleaning commonly touched surfaces is importantbecause even if a virus is spreadthrough airborne transmission,  those tiny droplets don't stay in the air for long. Then they land on surfaces,  waiting to be touched by our hands. Which raises an important point. The ultimate defense against catching a virus is just don't touch your face.  Your eyes, nose, and mouth are like the single weak spoton the Death Star when it comes to viruses.  That's the only way they can get in to infect you. But as you can see here, not touching your face is easier said than done.  (bell dinging)And before you think, \"Yeah, well, that's just kids for you, \" this was what the teacher's face looked likeat the end of the day. And she said she tried extra hardto remember not to touch her face.  I found this result fascinating, so I put the powder on my own hands for a few hours.  And I resisted the urge to touch my face so many timesthat I fully expected I was going to have a perfectly clean face and the moral high ground. And then this is what I saw.  (Mark laughs)What the heck?    I genuinely have no ideawhen any of this came on.  (tape rewinding)Until I reviewed the footage. Oh, well, there you go.  On average, we touch our face 16 times an hour,  which is why washing hands is so important. It's impossible to catch a virus directly through your hands. It's as futile as shooting the outer surfaceof the Death Star. The problem is, we use our hands to help the virus out by constantly giving it a rideto our figurative Death Star exhaust ports.  (guns shooting)(explosion booms) Because of this, I ran another experiment with some of the kids after lunch. First, I had them put some lotion on their hands that also glows under a black light. But then I told them I made a mistakeand used the wrong lotion.  Could you guys just go wash your hands real quick?   And do a good washing, right?    - 20 seconds. - Yeah. Do the right washing, okay?   I just tricked you guys again, because what I really wanted to do is test how good you are at washing your hands. So guess what I'm gonna do now?   - [Children] What?    - Show me your hands. But before I show you how effective they actually wereat washing their hands, here's what you should quickly know about viruses.  They're super tiny, but also the most abundant biological entity on the planet.  In fact, there's over 10 million virusesin any single drop of sea water.  And a lot of types of viruses are beneficialto the planet's ecosystem, and only an insanely tiny percentage affect humans at all.  And they're really simple. Viruses are basically a shell with some DNA inside,  and they just wanna spread and duplicate. That's their only goal. But they're so simple that they need a host to do that.  So they reproduce by infecting their host cellsand then trick them to become factories that just make more exact copies of the virus. When you get sick and then cough or sneeze or wipe your noseand then touch a surface, you're putting copies of this virus out to find other hosts and just repeat the process. And so here's what the kids' hands look likeafter washing their hands. Uh-oh, look at the backs. (children laughing) Let me see your fingernails!Oh, look at all those germs!Oh, your thumb! - Oh, my hand- - Oh, look at your wrist!Look at your wrist!We all sort of have a habitual way of washing our hands.  So once again, I tried this myself using the typical quick way I do it in my muscle memory. Granted, that's better than nothing, but you could see the difference comparedto when I was deliberate and took 20 seconds,  which is why it helps to do thingslike sing the \"Happy Birthday\" song twice, or you could do what I do and follow Brandon Flowers' example. ♪ Jealousy, turning saints in ♪ ♪ Eager eyes ♪♪ 'Cause I'm Mr. Brightside ♪ - And then for a final experiment, I wanted to show how dumb handshaking is.  So I infected the first kid with the powderand then had them do a handshake chain down the line.  The fifth person here still had significant traceson their hand, so I put him at the first and lined four more kids up after him, and three of their hands glowed. So we got trace germs from the original person all the way down eight handshakes later. So if you ever meet me in real life,  please don't be offendedif in lieu of a handshake I offer you a fist bumpand a selfie. (camera shutter clicks)In conclusion, what does this all mean with regards to the coronavirus COVID-19?   You should be concerned and take this seriously,  but regardless of what you see in the coming weeks, there's absolutely no need to panic. As I'm sure you've heard a bunch by now,  our goal is to flatten the curveso that reported cases stay just under the capacity of the healthcare system, and social distancing is the best knobthat we can turn to affect that. The reason this helps should hopefully make more sense after watching this video, especially for those who have been doubting the science and feeling like this is an extreme reaction. And my take here is I'm a practical optimist. The upside is while this virus is bad,  it could be way worse. And this gives us a chance as a global community to get some systems and methods in placeto handle something potentially even more drastic in the future. Also, maybe it'll lead to changing some social norms, like replacing handshakes with fist bumps or when people are really sickthinking it's okay to mingle about and go to work. Globally, the normal flu kills anywhere from a quarter to a half a million people a yeardue in large partto people not practicing good germ hygiene.  So if this experience makes people more socially awareof the right precautions to take when they get sick,  that will save countless lives for years to comelong after this coronavirus is old news.  And make no mistake, this is gonna be rough for some more than others, but history has shown that us humans are pretty resilient.  These types of things can bring out the worst in us, but they can also bring out the best,  most wholesome parts of us, like these Italians practicing their social distancingwith an impromptu balcony concert.  (people singing in foreign language)How we feel about the situation is largely dependent on just which part we choose to focus on. For me, that means being grateful to the heroes in our healthcare system, or the school lunch ladies still providing free lunchfor kids who depend on them,  or the scientists all over the worldwho are working tirelessly seven days a weekto create better testing methods in a vaccine.  This is gonna be a bumpy ride for us, but the economy will eventually bounce back,  as it always does, and we'll be better off as a global communityfor having gone through this.  Again, take this seriously, but there's absolutely no need to panic. We totally got this.  (stream burbling)(upbeat music) (Mark screams) (snowballs thudding) (kids screaming)  \n","- Car versus trampoline in 3, 2, 1.Flip it. - Oh my gosh. This is a car, and this is a trampoline I designed specifically to be strong enough to try and bounce a car, or I guess technically even a boat. Today we'll be conducting some experiments tosee what happens when you drop all sorts of stuff on a steel trampoline weighing two tonswith a mat made out of Kevlar being heldby 144 garage door springs.  But to understand how we even got to this point, we need to go back six months ago when the guysfrom the How Ridiculous YouTube channelissued a challenge. - We need to get someone to help us engineer just an epic trampoline that can bounce almost anything big. And I've got Marky Rober on mind. - And what you need to know about them, is that besides having funny accents,  they do all sorts of crazy things usuallyhaving to do with gravity in some form or another. Their content is always mind-blowing so you should subscribe to their channelif you somehow haven't already. At any rate, a lot of people seem to thinkthis was a worthy challenge, including myself.  And so I got together with my buddy Joshand first brainstormed ideas, then we did some math, then we designed it in CADand ran it through a dynamic analysisand eventually settled on a design and sent the build plans to one of their buddieswho lives near the tower. And so a few months later, all that was left to do was walk to Australiato meet the guys and check in on the build.  Wow. The mat is made from Kevlar, which is the same stuff bulletproof vests are made of.  It's so tough, the only thing that could cut itto the right shape was an angle grinder. The garage door springs can support about450 pounds a piece, and we have 144 of them.  It's like a thigh master. - Do they have those in Australia?   (funky electronic music) - And so after prepping at the shop, we made our way to the tower to put it all together.  (funky electronic music continues)  Wohoo!After seven hours, by 1:00 AM it was all put together. So after a very short night's rest and six months of planning, the moment had finally arrived. The plan was to do 10 drops total, five for their channel and five for mine.  They started with the single bowling ball, but not to be outdone, and to stay true to the tradition of my channel(intense rock music) I chose a single watermelon. You're not going to drop it, right?   You're gonna have to coach me through this. - I'll coach you through it. - Mr. Rober, we are good down here, mate.  - Also, it turns out I don't really love heights. Whoa. This is terrifying. I don't know how you guys do this, man.  Ready?   - Okay, here we go. - 3, 2, 1. - Bingo. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Oh, crap. (car alarm blaring)- I'm just kidding.  (watermelon exploding) Whoa.  Oh, I'm going to faint. (watermelon exploding in slow-mo)- The slow-mo of that would've looked sensational though,  to be honest. - That was dope. Next step for them was 20 bowling balls,  which was insane and you'll have to watch iton their channel after this. But naturally, I had to answer in kind with 20 watermelons.  We just got a sack of melons right here. We're talking 20 melons, about 400 pounds. - 190.- That's a lot. So they have these tubes here for the kids to drop water balloons down to line it up with a sand pit. So I'm gonna try and film through it, see what I can see. And let me just say it's never cool to waste food.  So we ate a good portion of the carnageyou're about to witness. Plus, food is never wasted on quality scientific data. - Oh, yes.  - Yes. Just the sound alone is just like terrifying.  (watermelons exploding) Vick, that was good. (watermelons exploding in slow-mo)     - Yeah. Woo. And just to give you a sense of scaleof the monster we created, here you can see us standing next to a normal trampoline.  And not only do we have twice as many springsas a trampoline, but here's a clean comparisonof the two sizes. My primary design goal was to have the tramp survive, but I also didn't wanna cheat and use the ground to dissipate any of the energy. The mat had to come back up cleanlywithout touching anything below. And now for the third drop out of five,  a 66 pound atlas stoneversus a tramp full of water balloons. - In 3, 2, 1 big in the middle.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Just missed the frame.  That would've been a jarring noise.       Are you happy with that Mark?   - That will do it. Come on, girl.  And while we struggled to hoist up my second to last dropof a yoga ball filled up completely with water, I'll take this opportunity to saythat my review of Australia was five out of five stars.  They have cooler signs, they've got better snacks, their moon is upside down, and their ticks are worse,  but their snakes are smaller than advertised. - All right, boys. - Flipping. Here we go. - Ready?    Should we just ease it up?    Okay. 3, 2, 1.- 3, 2, 1.Whoa, big speed. (both yelling) - It didn't pop.  (yelling replays)- Yes. Yes. (yelling replays) - Yes. Yes.   - It's not meant to bounce. - But it did. - That was so epic. (serene music)  (springs rattling)(ball popping) (water splashing)    - I feel like we did really well. The lift. - Oh, that felt good. This time I had the balls, the intestinal fortitude, to look over the edge. And so finally after a bit of precautionary lightweighting on the car, the big moment had arrived. - Have you decided you're doing the car before the boat?   Because it seems to be that's what's happening. - Yeah. - It's going up.  - I've made that decision. So in case you know the trampoline gets busted, at least I've got a dope video. (all laughing)You gotta look out for number one, you know what I mean?   - The thing is- - You guys know that much.  First of all, this is a hundred kilograms heavierthan we analyzed and it's 10 meters higher. I could see it hitting, flipping over and impaling itself on the fence, or hitting, flipping over, and landing right on the boat. - It would be sad, but also hilarious. - That's content baby.  This is legitimately the most nervous I've ever beenin 10 years of making videos. - I mean, it's fair enough. - Car versus trampoline in 3, 2, 1. But before we drop the car, I want to quickly explainwhy I was so stoked to receive this challenge. Usually for my builds, I have an idea and a design.  And while there's always testing, I've never had the need to actually analyze somethingusing a computer. (water spraying) (people screaming) A lot of you guys know I worked for NASA for nine years, but up until about six months ago, I also worked at Apple for four yearsin their special projects group. And in both cases, what we did for this video is the best example of what I did on a daily basisas a mechanical engineer. It's this loop of designing something in CAD, and then analyzing it to see if it's good enough,  and then you test it to check your answers. Using computers to analyze a design allows us tobuild much more complicated systems than beforewhen computers weren't as powerful.  This giant ice block was from one of their drops, and you could see how close our analyzed prediction wasto what happened in real life. This means that we could be confident the trampoline would be strong enough before we even built it. And this idea that we can understand and predict the worldaround us using math and equationsis what first made me fall in love with sciencewhen I took high school physics.  By doing math I can tell you it will take exactly0.83 seconds for this egg to hit the ground. There could be opposing philosophiesand governments and opinions around the world,  and we'll never get agreement on who is most right. But if all the scientists and engineerson the planet were to get together and hang out, they'd all be friends and they'd be like, yeah, we solved it too.  And 0.83 seconds is exactly what we also came up with. (egg cracking)And I find that to just kind of be simple and beautiful. - Car versus trampoline in 3, 2, 1. - Oh my gosh. (car slamming) - Oh. - Wohoo. (car continues slamming)- Yes. - Oh.    - Gosh. - Oh.  - Yeah. - Yeah. - What the freaking heck.        - It's finished wheels down.  - 10 for the dismount. - We flipping bounced the car. - Oh, so tramp, that's the only bit of damage.  - Yeah, this is where it plastically deformsand it won't go back to its original shape. - Okay. - So we got a few of those that did that- Oh, look at this. We just bent this. - Oh. - That's freaking one inch steel man. Car must have come down and hit right here on this spot.  We didn't want the car to hit the fence'cause that would be expensive to repair. Inches, centimeters, nay millimeters of clearance. The perfect landing.  All right, so you thought the car was crazy. Now, we're doing a boat. - We're doing the boat. Oh, it's wide- (electronic music)  \n","- That's me, that's the richest man in the world, and that's the burger I just made him. But there's a catch. The patty in that burger is made from this stuff. And the reason I can eat it rawis it's made entirely from plants.  As you guys know, every year, I dedicate one of my 12 videos to showcase how clever peopleare using science and technologyto change the world for the better. So, for example, two years ago,  it was a paper centrifuge and microscopethat could diagnose malaria for 51 centsversus $10000 for traditional equipment. And then last year, it was a magical powderthat helps poorer countries turn contaminated muddy water into clear drinking water. That's also when I first met Bill, and he earned my forever respectafter I microwaved up some pizza rolls for him, and he ate them like a champ. I've been loosely following the progress of plant-based meat for a couple years now, and allegedly it looks and tastes like meat, yet it's made from plants. Now, at the top of this video, I feel like I should start with a confession.  I eat meat, like, kind of a lot. I've had some form of meat at pretty much every mealsince I was a kid. My favorite genre of food is barbecue.  And so be that as it may, as a firm believer in the scientific method, I feel like it's time for me just to really buckle downand get to the bottom of this plant-based meat thing. And so today, on my quest for answers,  I'm looking at three main questions. Number one, how does it taste?   And not just that, but how does it look and feel and smell?   How successfully does it trick my braininto thinking this is real meat?    Number two, is it good for me?   If it does trick my brain, what the heck is in it?   Is it just some kind of, like, lab chemical concoction?   And also, how does it compareto, like, the protein from a real burger?    And number three, is it good for the planet?   And on this one, I have a hunch that it is, but is it like, meh, it's a little better, or is it like 100 times better?   Now, I should say a big motivation for me and something I think even my fellow meat eaterscould agree onis that the concept of factory farms isn't great. The whole cows that have never seen a blade of grass thing and pigs, which by most accounts are smarter than dogs, that live their entire lives indoors on crowded concrete. These factories are efficient. They're optimized for driving down costs, not for animal well-being.  And I'm not trying to be a downer. It's just something I don't like to think aboutwhen I'm eating my In-N-Out Burger or Chick-fil-A. And it's a lame excuse, but I feel like I sort of never have hada good alternative option.  I mean, historically, this is a veggie burger, and nothing about this works as a burger for me. But in recent years, the strategy shifted to target people exactly like me, basically try and make it as close to real meat as possible,  which reduces friction for trying a plant-based option. So their goal is, if I'm going meatless at the summer barbecue, instead of a quinoa salad, I can still enjoy the full experience of a burger with my friends. And so on that note, let's get right into question number one. Throw this puppy on the grill. (burger sizzles)Sizzle!It definitely sounds like a burger and even smells like it. And you're getting, like, the fat dripping down, which is causing the flames to come up. (burger sizzles)So, so far, the experience feels pretty analogous to just grilling a burger. When I lick the fork, it definitely tastes like there was meat on this fork.  All right, this cuts and feels exactly like a real burger. But before I officially taste it, I kind of wanna know exactly what's in there.  And to do that, I'm gonna fly out to the two companieswho are the leader in this space, Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods. At Beyond Meat, the first thing they showed mewere the labs where they do all their research. Are these actual, are these actors,  or these are real scientists?   - These are scientists, yeah. - This feels like \"Jurassic Park, \"you know, where they're, like, giving you the tour. And right out of the gate, they put my mind at ease and showed me a tray of all the main stuffthat makes up their burgers. Apparently, they work on not just the taste, but they have teams of researchersworking on the texture, color, the smell, the grilling sound,  even the same amount of calories and proteinas a meat burger. Their goal is to make it as frictionless as possiblefor people like me to make the switch. So they have these for the color, coconut and sunflower oil for the fat so it sizzles on the grill, potatoes for carbohydrates, and then these for the protein, the majority coming from yellow peas. These burgers are better for youbecause they have no cholesterol,  but they do have saturated fat from the coconut oil, so you shouldn't think of thisas healthy as, like, a plain salad with no dressing. After getting the full tour, I was feeling pretty good, so it was time for the real test in the kitchen.  I've intentionally kept my taste buds virgin. - Okay, great. - And I haven't tasted it, and I had opportunities, but, like, no, I wanna wait. No pressure, but next week, I'm going to meet Bill Gates.  - Yeah. - And I have to cook for him. You're like a professional chef, right?   - [Chef Chris] I am. - In the next like 20 minutes, you need to transfer all that knowledgefrom your brain into mine, okay?    We started with their Italian sausagemade, of course, just from plants, and Chef Chris showed me some power movesto impress Bill with on the grill. I'm so scared. - [Chef Chris] Cheers. - Okay, cheers.  Even putting flavor aside-- [Chef Chris] I think Bill will be okaywith a little bit of a juice. - There's no way I would've guessedI wasn't actually eating real meat. That's pretty good.  - [Chef Chris] Cheers. - Cheers. That's really good. I need one more taste. That's freaking good. - Thank you. - Next up was their burger,  which, it turns out, was equally amazing. Genuinely, when you surround it with burger stuff, it's really hard to tell. - There's no way to tell.  - My next trip was to Impossible Foods, and they actually let me make a burger myselfjust from the ingredients in these bowls. - So the first thing that we're gonna dois add the water to the soy protein, and then we're gonna add the potato protein.  - Okay. - So the next thingwe're gonna put in is our magic ingredient, which, do you know what this is?   - Red #5, it's just food color. (laughs)- So this is our magic ingredient. It's called heme, which is short for hemoglobin.  Heme is responsible for making meat taste like meat. That's found in every living plant and animal. You can get heme from soy plants.  - I see. - You don't have to get it from animals. - Next we added the cellulose-based culinary binderto hold everything together, and then finally the coconut and sunflower oils.  - Have you done any pastry work in your life?   - Oh, tons of pastry work. - Okay. You're gonna, like, fold and smush. - All my pastry work's shining through. - You literally just made the Impossible Burger yourself.  - Like, five little cups. - Five bowls, yeah. - One of them was water. - One of them was water. - So now I think it's time to cook one of these up. - 96% of the folks who are ordering our product are self-identified meat eaters. - I'm definitely your target demo. I grew up, like, if the meal didn't have meat in it, it wasn't a meal. - When it deliversin that same characteristic that meat does,  it really proves the pointthat we are providing a no-compromises alternativefor those meat eaters out there to make a different choice. - [Mark] This raised an interesting point. Meat has been cleverly marketed with being a real man because real men need their protein. - [Spokesperson] That's what a man eats. - [Spokesperson] Made from stuff guys need. - [Spokesperson] Eat like a man, man. - [Mark] But the truth is, even meat eaters like meget roughly half their protein a day from plants by eating things that containsome kind of beans, peas, nuts, or whole grains like corn, rice, and oats. In fact, many high-performance athletesare switching to a plant-based diet because studies have shownit can help reduce measures of inflammationby almost 30% in just three weeks, and inflammation makes it harder to recover after a workout. So if a plant-based diet is good enough for Arnold Schwarzenegger, Kyrie Irving, Lewis Hamilton, Venus and Serena Williams, Nate Diaz, and a growing butt ton of others, it's probably good enough for meand my weekly rec league soccer game.  ♪ Ballin' like Curry ♪- [Chef] You can ultimately utilize thisin any way you would use traditional ground beef. - So tacos, lasagna, meatballs. - You name it.  (mellow music)- This is so good. This is a plant-based burger, and look at the mess I'm making.  So obviously I thought their burgers were also really good, but I felt like I wanted a larger sample sizebefore I felt truly confident feeding Bill. So I invited some friends to a local restaurant that serves Impossible burgers. And the thing is, you can't always trust adults'cause they might just change their answer to be nice. - It's really good. - Kids, on the other hand, are brutally honest, so we ordered them plant-based burgers, too. . .  - Do you like it?    - It's juicy. - [Mark] But might have neglectedto mention it to them beforehand. What do you think?   - It's really good. - [Mark] There's no meat in that burger.  - Wait, what?   You're lying. - [Mark] Plants. - What?    - [Mark] That was a plant burger. You ate a plant burger. - Instead of meat, it was vegetables?   - It just tastes, like, extra juicy. (laughs) - And so feeling more confident than ever, it was time to visit Bill, put my culinary skills to the test, and see if he could help me answer my final question. So I'm back in Bill's kitchen.  He's gonna be here in an hour, and I need some groceries. (upbeat music) All right, Bill.  - Hey. - It's good to see you again. - How are you?   - So I've been working hard in your kitchen. - Perfect. - And I kind of wanted to talk to youabout plant-based meat, and I thought maybe we could try them out as well.  - Sure. - But as a control, I know you're a big fan of Dick's burgers, so to kind of cleanse the palate, I thought we could just take a bite. - That's the real thing. - The real thing.  As a non-Seattle native, I've gotta say, I think this may be an acquired taste. - Yeah, you get used to a certain burger. - You get used to it. And so now it was time for my cooking.  (jaunty music)What do you think?   - It's quite good. I mean, that's light-years away from what they used to make.  - Like the traditional veggie burger?   - Right. You know, the quality's gonna keep getting better. If the plant-based guys are not done innovating, eventually, they claim you won't be able to tell the difference. - [Mark] Next up was my killer bratwurst. - Wow. Well, that's pretty good. - [Mark] And at this point in my quest,  I felt like I had a pretty good lockon questions one and two, so I asked him about number three. - The agriculture sector is about 18% of overall emission, but livestock is about half of that 18%.  - Wow. - And almost all of that is beef. - Is this like cow farts, cow burps?   - Slightly more burps than farts,  but it's a mix of those two. - It's a mix. To put that into perspective, that means that sector alone is responsiblefor more greenhouse gases than all the cars, trucks, trains, ships, and planes combined.  Turns out it takes a lot of stuff to make a cow. - Very inefficient, particularly beef, it's almost eight to one. You use eight calories to feed that cow for every calorie of meat you get out of itbecause you're building bone and respiration for that cow. - Now, this was a really good pointI hadn't fully considered.  If you think about it, as humans, we're really solar powered. We eat plants, but they get their energy from the sun. Then you might be like, \"Ah, we also eat animals though. \"But they get their energy from plants, too,  which, again, get their energy from the sun. So when it comes to getting our energy from the sun, animals are an inefficient middleman. We get on average 10% of our caloriesor energy in a day from meat.  That might sound reasonableuntil you look at the amount of resources it takesto make that meat compared to the other 90%. If you combined all the land in the USdedicated to raising animals,  you would get an area like this, and then plus this much moreto grow the crops needed to feed those animals. Now, remember, all of that is for the middleman, for 10% of our daily energy.  Now compare that to the amount of land neededfor crops we actually eat ourselves directly. That relatively small chunk of landis where the overwhelming majorityof our personal energy comes from.  And it's not just land resources, but water as well. To end up with 24 hamburger patties, it requires the amount of water you see in this pool. That same amount of watercould make 75 loaves of whole grain bread and 30 jars of peanut butter. So if I made myself a delicious peanut butter sandwich, which has nearly the identical amountsof both calories and proteins compared to this patty,  and then I ate two a day, the meat would last me a little over a weekand the sandwiches would last me a little over a year. So that's the same amount of resources used, same amount of calories and protein to me per serving.  One just lasted me a year longerbecause it's a much more efficient energy transfer method. This is why a plant-based dietis a way more efficient use of natural resources.  We could feed an additional 3. 5 billion people worldwideif all countries just ate the stuff they fed to animals. And here's why that fact matters. - Particularly as people get richer,  they tend to eat more meat. If we don't do anything, this sector will actually grow over time. - So you're saying not just the factthat there's more people and a larger population,  but as people move up towards the middle class, they want to consume more meat. And you could certainly see that this is truewhen you look at the amount of meat consumedover the past 50 years. Given the resources required,  a trajectory for meat consumption like thisis simply unsustainable. A few decades ago, meat was considered a luxury product, but now it's a commodity for a growing number of people.  In fact, the demand is growing so much, it now makes sense for farmers in the Amazonjust to burn it downand to turn that forest into grazing land for animals. We've irreversibly lost 20% of the Amazon so far,  and that's a double gut punch'cause now not only is that more cow fartsadding to climate change, but when you burn those trees, all the carbon stored inside them goes back into the atmosphere as the greenhouse gas CO2. - One of the great tragedies about climateis that it's the poorest in the world, the farmers who live fairly near to the equator,  that all this heat and flooding and droughts, they're going to suffer by far the most. If you're just trying to get people to cut back, don't eat meat, don't drive to work, don't take trips.  It's such a dramatic set of sacrificesthat everybody has to engage inthat, without innovation,  we're probably gonna go way past the two degrees. - And that last part is the silver lining. Plant-based meat is the exact kind of innovationBill's referring to here. And I'm optimistic because as the demand for plant-based meats goes up, the price will come down, much lower than actual meat. So then not only will the experiencebe identical to eating meat, but it's better for you, better for animals,  and much better for the planet. Oh, and it also costs half as much. It just becomes a really easy decisionfor people to switch in massive numbers. All right, so what does this all mean?    Now that I've completed my quest for answers, where do I stand?   And I'll say it still makes me really uncomfortableto think about these factory farmsor the Amazon being burned down to make room for more cows.  But at the same time, I can't really blame these poor remote farmerswho know nothing about what a greenhouse gas isfor just trying to feed their family. As long as the demand for meat continues to grow,  there will be an incentiveto be not cool to our mutual friend, Mother Earth. So the most effective thing we can dois try and reduce that demand.  So after all this, I'm not a vegan. I'm not even strictly on a plant-based diet. But I have reduced the amount of meat I consumeby more than half, and I feel great.  Importantly, I broke out from that weird mindsetthat for it to be considered a true meal, it has to have some form of meat. So if any part of this video rings true to you, I would say don't take my word for it,  try it for yourself. You can find plant-based meat optionsin thousands of restaurantsand even at Burger King and Carl's Jr. Most grocery stores have a whole section dedicated to them,  so you can substitute itinto your favorite home-cooked meal. And remember, it doesn't have to be binary, like you either eat no meat or you're frickin' Ron Swanson. If a bunch of people did Meatless Monday, for example,  that would have a huge impact on demand. Some of the challenges we face globallycan feel pretty daunting, and so I love seeing clever peopleinnovating on the front lines, trying to make it as easy as possible for the rest of us to make the right choices. It gives me hope about our future here togetherand inspires me to wanna do my part. - I actually thought of all the toughest climate problems that livestock was going to be the toughest. Now with these companiesand other ones coming along in this space, I'd say steel and cement are now the two that I'm still scratching my head. - Well, if anyone's gonna be scratching their headto solve the problem, I think humanity is grateful Bill Gates is the one doing it.  So on behalf of, I don't know, the world, we appreciate the efforts you're making in this. I have some celebratory pizza rolls. Last year, I made you eat- - Oh!- Actually, they're frozen. You don't want those. - Uh-oh, thank you.  - It's just a prop. I'll spare you. - You tricked me, Mark Rober!(upbeat music)  \n","- [Mark] This guy stole my package, and he's about to open it in his house. - Hello. (machine whirring)- [Mark] But what he doesn't knowis that this is a new and improved, custom-built bait package that is recording himon four different cameras, that just released a pound of the world's finest glitter, along with some other nasty surprises. (machine whirring)- What the (beeping)?   - [Mark] But to understand how we got to this point,  we need to go back one and a half years, (tape warbling)because that's when someone stole a packagefrom my porch and the police wouldn't do anything about iteven with the video footage, which made me sad.  And so, drawing inspiration from one of my childhood heroes, I decided to make a bait package to lure would-be thieves, and the internet seemed to like it.  But despite my best efforts, 1.7 million packagesare either stolen or go missing every day. (hinge creaking) (choir singing)- Hello. - Macaulay Culkin?    (air whooshing)- (beeping). (door shutting)- No, no, no, no, no, wait!(air whooshing)- (sighs) I'm sorry.  It's just that \"Home Alone\" was the entire inspirationfor the Glitterbomb. - No, no, that's cool. I love that. Just that I do other things with my life, like run my website, bunnyears. com. But seriously though, your design was good,  but actually I think I can make it a little bit better. (air whooshing) (paper crinkling)- [Mark] And so with Macaulay's help, my friend Sean and Ihave literally spent the last 10 months designing, building, and testing a new and improved design for 2019.  So today I'm gonna walk you through all the upgrades, and then show you what happens when you unleash10 of these bait packages on random suburban porches all across America. We started with a complete redesign of the box, to make it more streamlined and secure. For contrast, last year's design was a bit of a rat's nest. The fundamentals are still the same, where you have a battery powered, custom printed circuit boardon the bottom that has a built-in accelerometerso it can sense when it's been jostled. And then it tells these four phones to start recording. And these are wide angle lenses, so as you can see,  you'll be able to record the thiefno matter which side they open it from. And then right here, we have some fart spray, but we added a second bottle this year. So as both these motors spin cams around,  not only does it spray twice as much, but we changed the formula this time around. And it is wretched. - Dude! (laughing)Oh man. Oh, it's in my mouth, man.  I feel like I just ate a turd. Never done that, to be clear. - And just to prove how much worse it was, I sprayed last year's formula labeled A,  and then this year's formula labeled B, for 10 different people, without telling them which was which. - Oh, that's like proper poo. (laughing) (both laughing) Oh God. He just took a dump on my face. (bottle spritzing)(Macaulay gagging) - I still smell it. (Macaulay coughing)- [Mark] I'm sorry, I killed Macaulay Culkin. (laughing) (kids giggling)- Smells like poop!- So A or B, that- - B, B. - B by a mile. - It's B.  - [Mark] All 10 independently agreed, this year's was much worse. (upbeat music beginning)And then we keep spraying it every 30 seconds to ensurethey get rid of the package outta their housebefore they realize there's four phones inside.  This increases our chances of recovering it, since we already know the package location at all times, due to the GPS tracking on all the phones. But even if we somehow don't recover it,  all these phones have LTE data plans. So they'll upload their footage to the cloud right awayso then we can see what happened. And then we have the main course, which is the spinning cuppowered by a motor underneath here,  which we fill with the finest glitter we could find, which is actually biodegradable this year, as a nod to our good friend, Mother Earth. We also added sound effects this year. So after both the glitter and the fart spray have successfully deployed, we start counting down- [Recording] Five, four, three. - Nothing actually happens at the end, but they won't know that.  And then finally, after that, (police radio recordings playing)we added some fake police scanner chatter, just because it seemed like the right thing to do. - [Recording] Seems the package may in motion as well.  - [Mark] So as you can see, once you slipped this cover overit becomes nearly impossible to access the phones nowwithout special tools. And so finally, we've got the lid, which has these two holes here,  which we cover with one-way film, so we can record the outside world even when the lid is on. And you'll notice this is a total custom print. These are the fictitious BUZZ700s,  named, of course, after Kevin's older brother. And if the thieves took just two secondsto actually inspect the package, they would see that all the words on the sideare just slightly modified quotes from \"Home Alone, \" in addition to this amazing testimonial. And so then we just slapped on a fake shipping labeland used a random barcode sticker to cover upthe nightly charging port, and we were good to go. So the idea is the bad guy comes sneaking by,  and then steals it off the porch. And then when they eventually remove the lid, a magnet taped inside triggers this hall effect sensor, which tells the circuit board brain \"It's go time, \" and everything is set in motion. And as far as I'm concerned, relatively harmlesskarmic justice has never looked so beautiful. (relaxed electronic music playing)  And so now, all that was left was to find porchesfor all the boxes. So I sent out a call to all my followers on social media,  and we received over 400 applicants who have all dealtwith repeated package thefts in the past. And then from that, we narrowed the list down to just a handful, and soon we had packages out all over the country.  We also set up a website so I could sit in my bat cave hereand monitor all the boxes to see their current locations, record states, battery phone levels, and even check the camera feed on any box at any time.  And things started out a bit rockywhen we got a notification that the first box was stolen, and then we noticed it was intermittently movingall throughout the city. So while we were trying to locate it we checked the feed and realized a UPS driverwas so convinced the package was real, he scanned it and picked it up, and it was riding around in his truck. Next, when someone else picked up the box,  we didn't have the lid seal fully worked out yet. So as they were walking around, glitter started to spill out. - [Thief #1] Oh, look at that. There's glitter coming out of it. Oh, it's totally a scam. Yo, Nick! - [Mark] Which is, as they say, very much. . . - Dead giveaway!- [Thief #1] It's totally a scam. When you open it, it's gonna explode with glitter. (electronic beeping) (cover scraping)- [Recording] Hello! - [Mark] This lady took it off a porch, but opened it upside down. As soon as she heard the countdown timer, though, she rushed it back to the porch she stole it from, just in time for nothing to happen.  (air whooshing)But then the thefts began to pile up, and we started hitting our stride. (cover scraping) - Hm?   (machine whirring) Whoa. Oh my God. I mean. . . - What is that?   I don't know, let me put it back. Where's the. . . (package banging) It's a mess. (Thief #5 gasping) - You gotta go back. (cardboard rattling) - [Recording] Recovery sequence initiated. (police scanner recording playing)(cardboard squeaking) - [Recording] It seems the package may be in motion as well. (cardboard rattling) (metal unlatching)(hinge squeaking)(dumpster reverberating)(electronic beeping)- [Recording] Hello!- What?    (machine whirring)- [Recording] Keep the change, ya filthy animal.  (cams whirring)- [Thief #6] Stuff flew all over, the sparkles. Look at this (beeping). - [Thief #7] 'Cause you opened it, yeah. It's like remember that guy, that money,  open money turned blue?   That's, wipe that down please. - What kind is this?   Yeah, but I got the (indistinct) and the smell, it stinks, and all the stuff shot out.  - [Thief #8] What do you mean?    Oh, that was a. . . (cams whirring)Open it and throw it out. (box thumping) - [Person #1] Caught yourself some glitter!(glitter crumbling)(cams whirring) - [Recording] Operation \"Super Nasty Fart\" initiated. - Hm. (package thumping)- [Recording] 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10,  (cams whirring)nine, eight, seven. . . (electronic beeping)(package scraping)- [Recording] Hello. (package scraping) - Whoa.  - [Thief #10] What the (beeping) just happened?   - [Recording] Keep the change, ya filthy animal. - [Thief #10] What'd it say?   (cams whirring)Well, you opened it, dude. - [Thief #9] Well damn, bro.  - [Thief #10] What happened?   (both laughing)(package scraping) Nah, there isn't. What the (beeping) is it?   - [Thief #9] Well, it's still a speaker. (audio crackling)- What the (beeping) is this?    - What is it?    - Dude. - [Thief #11] There has to be stillsomething in there, right?   (package rustling) What is it?   - [Thief #9] Hey, good afternoon. (glitter rustling) (trash can thumping)- [Thief #11] No, dude. What the. . . (cams whirring) - [Recording] Nine, eight, seven, six, five, - Whoa, back the (beeping) up- - four, three, two, one. . . - [Woman] (laughing) Get out of my store!(police radio recordings playing) - I don't know, dude! - Get out!(police radio recordings playing)- [Recording] I'm about six minutes away.  - What the (beeping)?   (package scraping) - You wanted to open it, dude. I told you not to open it. - [Thief #9] Dude, what is that?   - [Woman] Are you. . . Get out!Get out! - Yeah, okay. - And then you smell it. - Wah! - (beeping) (thieves coughing)- What's it smell like?    - I don't know, that (beeping) is gnarly. - [Mark] After we tracked down this packageand recovered it by the dumpster, we walked by the storeand they were sweeping and spraying Febreeze,  which felt amazing. (electronic beeping)(package scuffing)- [Thief #12] Babe, I bought you some headphones. I bought you some Bose headphones, okay?   Some really good ones. (package scraping) - [Recording] Surprise, mother(beeping). (machine whirring)(tape warbling)(machine whirring slowly) (machine whirring)- [Recording] Keep the change, ya filthy animal. (cams whirring) - [Recording] Operation \"Whoever Smelt It, Dealt It, \"initiated. - (beeping). (cardboard rustling) Ugh. - [Recording] Operation \"Butt Trumpet\" initiated. - Aw, you (beeping). . . (cams whirring) All right, all right. We (beeping), all right, All right, we (beeping) get it. Okay. Smells like (beeping) (beeping) in here. (cardboard rustling) (electronic beeping)- And in the middle of all this,  something happened that I still can't wrap my head around. One of the volunteers we sent a package to, who obviouslyknows my channel and follows me on social media, who I even interviewed to make sure he seemed legit,  decided it would be a good idea to steal my package from me, and never had any intention of either putting it outon his porch or sending it back to us.  After a week of us being really niceand trying to work with him, he effectively admitted as such, and then blocked and ghosted me. And it's just like, bro, if you're gonna steal from someone,  don't pick the dude who just spent a year and a halfof his life avenging a theft of a $5 Amazon package.  If I'm willing to get that petty over somethingI could easily reorder, what do you think I'm gonna doto the guy who steals the outcomeof that year and a half of work?   I quit my job at NASA to make YouTube videos,  and I only make 12 of them a year. So I have plenty of time, and I love to obsessover these little details. Plus, even though this is more of a science channel than a prank channel, I love coming up with these ideas. Like when I took this Freddy Krueger action figureand taped it to the back of my wife's carright in front of the backup camera. (crowd cheering)So when she puts it in the reverse, this is a. . .  (crowd howling) (audience applauding)And so after a little detective work, I discovered he gave us his real name and phone number,  but he shipped it to his buddy's address. So I found his real address, and then did two relatively harmless things. (upbeat music beginning) The first is, I've heard once the Scientologists have your contact info and know you're even remotely interested, they will follow you the rest of your life. And so since I had all this contact info, hypothetically, I might have gone on their website and said I was very interested in learning more, and then ordered $300 worthof their starting course material. So they know he's a very high value contactworth keeping track of.  And the second thing was, I designed over 10 custom postcards just for him. For example, he's from Texas, so I thought a thank you notefor his $500 donationto \"Texans for Hillary Clinton's Presidential Campaign\" would be nice, or this registration confirmationfor the upcoming furry convention. But the trick is, while I addressed it in his name, I went on Google Maps,  and looked up his neighbors' addresses. And hypothetically, I might have accidentally sent themto a random assortment of houses around him. A lot of these are great, because it's the exact type of thing where the more you deny it, the more guilty you look. So some of these will inevitably be hand deliveredto his mailbox by his neighbors, who spot the error, and he'll always be second guessing just how many more there were, and who's silently judging him at the neighborhood potluck. Now, I wanna mention we encountered good peopleout in the world too, who were trying to actually keep our boxes from being stolen. For example, this woman did that, but even still, the package was stolen just 30 minutes laterby a professional porch pirate, who knew exactly how to cover up her face.  But then we said, hold up, roll that tape back. (tape warbling)Unbelievably, she has the same body typeand owns the exact same shoes and pantsas that good Samaritan.  So we turned the footage over to the police to seeif they too could appreciate the coincidence. And it just goes to show you that your conceptionof who a porch pirate is might be totally off. I'm just kidding.  This was a super nice lady who took the package infor her neighbor, but it got us thinking, and instead of just always punishing the bad guys, we wanted to try and reward the good guys. So in some cases, we left it by an apartment mailbox,  and we changed the label to a real name, and left tons of contact informationlike phone number and email all over the label. And quite a few people took the package back to their house,  but instead of opening it, they called to tell us they had our packagebecause they were worried someone else would take it. And so instead of glitter and fart spray, I gave them $400 because that was the opportunity cost for them when they made the right choice. - Thank you. - Thank you. - [Mark] For being one of the good ones, man. - [Man #1] Thank you. - [Mark] Others, however, didn't make the call.

This idea has been on my bucket list for over three years,  so today I'm gonna tell you how we made it, how exactly it works,  and what happens when you take it bowlingbut neglect to tell the people you're bowling with about your slight advantage.  - Oh. - So this trick ball looks and feels likea normal bowling ball,  and that's because it's made from a real bowling ball.  Step one on this project was to harness my innerLincoln and Dan to see what's inside an actual bowling ball.  The first thing we discovered is that they aren't symmetric.  That means the center of massisn't at the actual center point of the ball.  I won't get into physics here, but this is one factor that helps the pros curve the ball as much as they do. Next, I had my buddy Mark, who owns a machine shop,  hollow out the ball using a lathe.  Once that was done, we were left with two shellsand now I just needed to fill it with some engineering magic. And to do that, I need to get myself to London with a trustee four second travel montage. (upbeat music)  And the reason I needed to get to Londonwas because this is James Bruton and this is his house.  And what you should know about James,  aside from the fact that he's a mechanical, electrical engineer genius is he used to be a toy designer.  And I have so much respect for toy designers because they have to come up with really clever designslike this guy here where you could see all of this actionpowered by a single spring so it can remain inexpensive.  And his super clever designs include this robot you could control using this puppet robot or this real life Ironman or Hulkbuster suit,  or a bunch of really cool BB-8s. I had a basic idea for the mechanism in the ball,  and I knew I wanted the guts to be sort of like a BB-8. So I reached out to himand in the spirit of full disclosure, it was his expertise that really made this whole thing possible. So if you enjoy seeing awesome stuff like this,  you really need to go check out his videos and subscribe to his channel. And so after geeking out in his housefor way longer than we should have,  we put the ball togetherand headed to a proper British bowling alley for the first official test. We started at pretty low speeds just to prove we had things basically correct. Then we started getting fancy and eventually worked up to hitting some pins.  Yeah.  That is a cool feeling. And the reason I could control the ball by leaning is because I have this little board taped to my backthat has an inertial measurement unit on it that can sense the orientation. So if I lean left, it sends that command back to the ball using radio waves, and then the ball has a receiver that gets the signal to turn left. And then this Arduino, which is the brains of the operation,  tells the servo motor how much to rotate,  which then rotates this heavy pendulum to the left. And that radically alters the center of gravity,  and it starts turning that way in response,  just like if you want to turn on a bikeyou adjust your center of gravity by leaning into the turn.  And if I want to bowl normalI can just click this limit switch and it will ignore all inputs. But as soon as I click it again,  then it will once again steer whichever way I lean. And at first we weren't really getting strikes but that's because my technique was wrong. Hitting the pins dead straight on will tend to leave the corner pins like this. To get a perfect strike,  the ball needs to approach the pinsomewhere between three and six degrees from this point.  And that's because at that angle, the ball hits this first pin and the normal force vector takes outall of these pins in a line and then the ball contacts this next pin here, and it takes out all of these pins in a line,  and then the ball's momentum takes out the final three.  Professional bowlers get their ball to hit the pinsat this side angle by curving the ball.  And you kind of have to do thatbecause if you suck at bowling like me and you can only bowl the ball straight,  if you extend that straight line out, you would need to bowl from the other lane over.  But technically that's not allowed. And so at that point, your remaining strategies are either bad CGI or mechanical engineering,  and we chose the latter. Once I got the angle right, we started locking in the strikes.   In addition to testing our ball, we got to see the machine they used to oil the lanes and the crazy fascinating machinethat clears and resets the pin after every frame,  but that's a topic for another video.  And so with everything working perfectly, it was time for the final test to see how it performed in real life. (upbeat music)So we arranged to meet some of our family friends at the local bowling alley. And at first I tried bowling normally with the controls turned off, but it turns out without the aid of mechanical engineering,  - Gutter ball. - I suck it bowling. - You're bad at bowling.  - [Mark] And nobody likes me.  So to get my street cred back, I clicked the switch on and explained I actually had Jedi powers.  - [Child] Whoa. - [Mark] And then I used said Jedi powers to steer the ball,   get some strikes, and reclaim my high five privileges.  (upbeat music)   (kids cheering) And it didn't take them long to catch onto the secret that rolling strikes was just directly proportional to how much you leaned. (bowling pins crashing) (upbeat music)      - You cheated again Mawk Rova.   (upbeat music)     \n","- This is the brand new Guinness World Record, largest ever elephant toothpaste foam experiment. In today's video, which is partially sponsored by LastPass,  I'm gonna walk you through everythingwe have to go through to get to this point, as well as some really cool side discoveries we made in our hundreds of hours of testing along the way. The main ingredient for elephant's toothpasteis hydrogen peroxide.  It's the same stuff you pour on a scrape to disinfect it. The thing is, the bonds that hold the hydrogenand oxygen together are pretty weak.  So if we poured some of this in here, and just left it for a while, it would keep releasing oxygen and eventually,  you'd be left with just water. However, if you add a catalyst like potassium iodide, you could make that slow process happen almost instantly.  (concoction hisses)So that's cool, but we can make it way more impressiveif we add one key ingredient, soap.  So if we pour this in and then do everything else the same, now when the oxygen is released,  the soap captures it, creating bubbles and foam. And then finally, if you do all that again, only now you add food coloring and use a flask that tapers like this, you can focus the expansion of foamso it looks maximum awesome.  (bright music)So in order to fill a pool with this stuff,  I first got together with some friends, and we spent literally hundreds of hours for a few weeksrunning experiments to calculate the best raw ingredient combinationsin addition to brainstorming other cool thingswe might do with it. And so before we attempted to shatter the current world record, we had an end-of-summer party with my sonand a bunch of family friendswhere we wanted to share with them the coolest side discoveries from our research. But first, in true end-of-summer fashion, we had to knock out some slip and slide kickball.  (upbeat music) (upbeat music) I planned to kick things off by attacking themwith an elephant toothpaste gun we madeas revenge for when a bunch of these same kids ambushed me on a recent beach trip, and then offered me some cookieswhich were just six massive cockroaches.  And I hate cockroaches. Shamoo! Get it off me!However, as part of our testing, we discover the reaction is highly exothermic,  which means it generates heat as a byproduct. If you watch it infrared, you'll see the temperature of the foam rightafter the reaction can reach almost 200 degrees Fahrenheit.  So, because I'm nice, I shelved my revenge plansand just demonstrated what would've been their fate,  and told them to sit and watch at a safe distance. And they listened, sort of.  And so now that we have their attention, it was showtime. - [Everyone] Three, two, one! - Go!(bright music) (bright music)This one is called the melted unicorn.  (bright music)  (bright music) (bright music)You might recognize Bob Pflugfelder here, AKA, Science Bob.  He's been on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live\" 11 more times than I have, and I invited him out to join me for a very specific reason,  which I will address in a bit. (bright music)  (bright music) And so with the success of the science show behind us,  it was now time for phase two. So we are here, standing in an empty swimming pool,  about to try and break the world recordfor elephant's toothpaste. You wanna tell the good peoplewho owns the current world record, Bob?    - I do. - You wanna tell the good peoplewho's about to not own the world record, Bob?   - Pretty confident, aren't you?   - (laughs) No, I'm not. - Mr. Engineer.  - But if everything goes well, we're hoping to quadruple the amountof the current record which you hold. I'm not sure how much of like the trees and neighborhood we're gonna cover in the process. (bell dings)Only time will tell, and chemistry, which I don't understand,  but we'll see what we can come up with. (bright music) (bright music) We wanted the foam to be safe to play in afterwards, so we used ordinary baking yeast as our catalyst.  We could have bought yeast in big buckets, but it turned out it was cheaper to get themin one pound bags. The only downside to that is then you have to cut open 181 pound bags of yeast, but that's why we have Science Bob.  - \"Come on out, \" they said. \"It'll be fun, \" they said. (bright music) - This is an emergency tarp system.  So if we did our math right, it shouldn't overflow. In the case that it does, we have these tarps here to contain all of the foamfrom not going everywhere in the yard. We hope for the best, plan for the worst.  (bright music)We built these three frames for the tarps that would contain the catalyst yeast solution. So when it was time to fill the pool, we could just cut the tarps and it would pour out.  The same way we cut the tarpwhen we added the bigger Orbeez. - I'm alive!- And Kevin. (motor whirring) It's go time, baby. We're probably like seven minutes out. Got a bunch of kids inside are just rearing to get out.  The challenge here is this water's warm. We didn't build these containers big enough,  so this will start rising. So it's sort of a race against the clockbefore it starts overflowing.  We still have to add the soap, and then we have to add the food coloring. (bright music) (bright music)Oh, this looks terrifying as I stab this bloody thing.  I think I'm about to get demonetized.  (bright music)(bright music) Okay, now we're adding the soap. - This is what will actually make the bubbles. Soap isn't part of the reaction.  (motors whirring)Two more soap buckets. Oh, as you can see, that bucket's filling up real quick.  (bright music) So after a few final touches, we were ready to go. Three, two, one! Now before we cut the tarps, I wanna point out I'm not a chemist. With the physics and engineering problem,  I'm way more comfortable understanding the parametersand getting closer to the final solution off the bat, but chemistry is just little molecules I can't see.  And it feels a lot like trial and errorwithout any guarantee it will actually scale up predictably.  This was feeling like the nightmare of the jello poolall over again. To get to this point, we had ran over 150 tests,  sometimes, at great peril to that which we hold dear. And so once again, if this was a total failure,  it wouldn't be from lack of effort. Having said all that, here she is. Two, one, go.  (liquid whooshing)  (liquid whooshing)  (children laughing)  So the good news is we broke the record. The bad news is we're kind of overachievers.  Uh oh. It's coming up. The great tsunami!Hey, hold this.  - [Child] Nope, goodbye camera. - [Mark] Okay, stand back off the tarp. - [Child] Goodbye camera!- We need to grab 'em, stand back.  Hold this up, Bob. Okay. ♪ Whew ♪(upbeat music) (upbeat music) So while we pushed all the foam back into the pool, that gave it some time to cool downso we could actually touch it.  (upbeat music) ♪ Whew ♪(upbeat music) The drone was super coolbecause not only did it make the foamlook like an alien cocoon, but you could see it travel in infrared because it would expose the much hotter, lower layersof foam as it flew around.  What do you guys think?   Do you think this is gonna float?   - [Children] No!- No?    All right, here we go. (upbeat music)  (upbeat music)(upbeat music) After all our tests, we perfected the chemistry for this stuff. So if you wanna make a home version you can play with,  check out Science Bob's website. I'll leave a link in the video description. - Oh my gosh! That's so fun! (upbeat music) (upbeat music) (upbeat music)♪ Whew ♪- All right, Bob. Sorry you're looking at an obsolete piece of material there. - I had it for over a year.  - You did have it for over a year, but all good things must come to an end.  - Say I was mad, but darn, that was a lot of fun. - That was a lot of fun. And I have good news because youare still the world record holder.  I'm putting you on there with me, buddy. Oh yeah, nerd hug.  (bright music) (people yelling) (snowballs striking) \n","(water splashing)- I texted this clip to my wifewho wanted proof I wasn't doing anything stupidon a recent trip to The Bahamas. Now, if you're wondering what my feet are doing in shark infested waterswith a bucket of blood 20 miles away from any land, well that comes down to a conversation I had with my friends at the Discovery Channel six months ago. They told me Shark Week is coming upand they wanna know what I would doif they could put me in the middle of the oceanon a boat surrounded by sharks.  For as long as I can remember, I've always wanted to testif sharks can really smell a drop of blood in the waterfrom a mile away. Now, before you say MythBusters already did this,  they, kind of, did this. As you can see, to test this they poked their fingersand then stuck them in a barrel with these tiny lemon sharks. And since they didn't really seem to turn aroundand look at their fingers, they said it was busted. Now, I'm friends with both Carrie and Adam,  but I think even they would've been, at least in this case, the methodology was less than scientifically rigorous. So I came up with a more robust test procedure,  built some NASA grade hardware for the experiment, hopped on a plane, and then a speedboat, and soon enough I was 20 miles offshore at the Bahamas.  What's up?    - Hey Mark. Dude, there's sharks. - There's sharks. We have sharks. - That's the first time I've ever seen a shark, like, in the wild.  Let's do some science. To kick things off, I sat down with my marine biologist, shark diving expert, friend, Luke Tipple, and explained my plan to him.  Eventually, I plan to test just how farthey could smell a single drop of blood in the water. But first I wanted proof that they actually preferred bloodover any other scent.  So for my first experiment, I plan to put four surfboards in the waterequal distant from the back of the boat. Each board would host two liters of a different liquid that we would pump into the oceanover the course of an hour. Then using a three meter radiusaround each board as a gauge, we would use drone footageand count how many sharks went over to check out each board.  So this board would be fish oil, which I heard was a general attractant for lots of fish. Then we would have cows blood here.  Then seawater here as a controlto make sure the sharks weren't just interestedin the surfboard. And then finally urine. I've heard from surfersthat a lot of them won't pee in their wetsuits 'cause they feel like it's gonna attract a shark. - I don't know a surfer alivewho doesn't pee in their wetsuit. (all chuckling)But yes, that's definitely something I've heard a lot.  - Gonna liberate surfers everywherewhen we show that it's cool to pee in your wetsuit. And so after a bit more discussion, Luke was on board for the first of our two experiments.  Well, as a firm believer in the scientific method, we'll test it out. - And then you dive?   - Well, depending on the results I dive. (all chuckling) I can't pee, the deals off. And so with that, we started putting the four boards together. (upbeat music) We also started collecting scientific donations from the crew. (whistling)- All right, so, now it's time to fill these bags. What do you wanna do first?    Pee or blood. - Yeah, I do. Let's do pee.  - Okay. - Let's do rock paper scissorsfor who holds the bucket and who holds the bag. (chuckling)- Okay. Wait, wait. - We'll do three shoots. I gotta strategize. Okay, I know what, I know what it is. Ready?    [In unison] One, two, three, shoots. Yeah! - Damn it. Oh, that smells so bad. It's urine. Whose ever it is they need to hydrate.  Dude, this is gonna be a nightmare. - Oh. Oh, it's warm. Oh dude, it's all over my hands.  You're pouring sucks. Oh!- Okay. - Ugh, that stinks. - No, we're good, we're good.  All in the name of science. - It's a great time of day to be doing this'cause we have a lot of sharks. Looking down here we got three or four lemons on the surface and I can actually see two tigers down on the bottom. And that's actually a massive tiger shark down there. - That is huge.  All right, see if you can do a better job pouringthan I did. Oh my gosh. Oh wow. There's a feeding frenzy. Ah! - Don't move it. It's fine.  What do you mean don't move it?   I almost lost my hands. - You did not. It's not gonna jump out of the water. - Okay, so you've got seawater as our control, fish oil. . .  - Have urine and cow's blood. - Let's do it. (lively music) So, while Luke is bravely swimming the four surfboards outand anchoring them in placein preparation for the one hour countdown,  now is a perfect time to explainthe cool tech on each boardI designed and built from scratch with my buddy Sean Hodges. For this experiment to be robust,  all four boards need to start pumping at the exact same timeafter Luke has them in place. That means we need to somehow start the pumps using a radio signal from the boat. So, each surfboard has a waterproof receiver box like thisthat also hosts the battery, a custom printed circuit board and two Arduinos.  Then I have the remote controland as soon as I hit this button. . . (mechanical whirring)They all start pumping at the same time.  We know each pump is workingbecause the corresponding yellow light is lit up. That's important because they're too far away from the boatto see if they're functioning properly.  To pump the blood and pee, we're using a peristaltic pump. This is a perfect choicebecause it's a totally sterile wayto get the blood from the bag to the ocean since the blood never touchesany sort of valve or something. It just has these rollersthat sort of pinch and push the blood through the tubingin a manner that just happens to be similar to a severed artery. And so with the boards in place, it was go time. Operation shark bait test thing commence! Three, two, one, beep. All four are going. We have confirmation.  Everything is rolling, the experiment is underway. We'll let them go for an hourjust dripping stuff out, and yeah, we'll see what happens.  - Okay Mark, I can confirmthat all four boards are working great. I can see a blood trail as far as my eye can seeon the blood board.  I'm going head back to the boatjust so I'm not a variable in this experiment. (water gurgling)- And after 10 minutes, I was really surprised there wasn't a lot of action on any of the boards. So, so far it's pretty interesting. I mean, we've shown if you have a massive cut and you're bleeding outand there's this many sharkswithin, like, 50 yards of youthat they're, kind of, like meh.  So, like, already, that's an interesting finding, right?   You'd think a little bit of bloodand there'd just be a massive swarm, but that's not the case so far.  And to be clear, we weren't dealing with small quantities here. The human body contains five liters of blood. And after you lose two liters, which is the exact amount we're putting in the water,  then you die. About 20 minutes in, things were still pretty quietespecially at the fish oil, urine and control boards.  But then the blood board started attractingsome smaller fishand soon after one or two sharks started taking notice.  Not a lot of love for my pee. I don't know why I find that kind of offensivebut I'm just a little hurt.  Eventually, with about 15 minutes left, things started getting pretty wild over by the blood board.  The blood was spread outand made almost like a blood runway. So you have this surreal line of sharksswimming up this enticing blood trail one after another,  only to be super disappointedto find a big piece of styrofoam. (quirky music) We're almost done. Three, two, one. The motors have stopped.  Our experiment is done. I'd just like to point out the bags have been sucked dry. So, the engineering partof this experiment works flawlessly.  - Dude, there's sharks everywhere. - Are you serious?   - Yeah. - There are two super pissed off tigers. - And so now it's time to go in and review the footage and get a final tally for each board. And what we foundwas that four sharks went to check out the fish oil,  then zero sharks went to check out both the controland the urine. And then the blood board had a direct visitfrom a whopping 41 sharks.  And so now that we debunk some surfing myths about urineand proved that sharks certainly had a strong preferencefor blood over anything we tested,  the real question was just how much bloodis interesting to them. And there was one part of the experimental designthat was really nagging at me.  'Cause that was cow's blood, right?   - That was cow's blood. You wanna do human blood?   - I wanna try human blood. - We've got at least10 living breathing blood bags around here. (chuckling) - It's worth noting, not everyone was as stoked as Luke and I about this idea. Yeah, and then just draw it. We'll just have fresh blood, just mainline it and put it in the water.  - Why not?    Would you be down?   - I'd be down. - Moondog, what do you reckon?   - Don't look at me man. (chuckling)- You can have all the pee you want. You can't have my blood.  (chuckling)- So Luke made some calls and soon enough we had anamazing, certified Bahamian phlebotomist on board. - I'm like, oh, I'm totally cool and, like, pop the ball.  (chuckling)(quirky music)And after some generosity from the camera crewand even Captain Scotty,  we had four bulging bags of human bloodfor our second experiment. This is my actual blood. We're gonna see if sharks have a taste for it. And if they do,  I probably won't go free diving with them. For the second experiment, we had three boards. Again, we placed the control in the middle. The board over here would pump the human blood slowly at one drop a minute, and then on the other side, this board would pump the blood fast, on average one drop every four seconds.  We were able to do thatbecause another cool feature for the boxes we builtwas that by turning this knob you can control the flow rateso over time they can pump out different amounts.  And because sometimes we all have to step upand just do our part while Luke, once again, risked his life by placing the three boards, I prepared to push a button.  Three, two, one, commence! All right. All of them are pumping and good to go. Now the clock's just ticking. We have like 55 more minutes to go.  We'll see if the sharks notice it. One drop of human blood every four secondsmay sound like a lot and it certainly is,  but it's also important to note, that's 40 times less than the first experimentwhere we saw so much activity. In this case, halfway into experiment number two,  even though there were tons of sharks still in the area, the boards themselves were pretty quiet. We'll have to see when we look at the footage afterwards,  But so far, it looks like the answer's no. Five, four, three, two, one, experiment's over.  And so after the full hour, we brought in the boardsand once again reviewed the footageto see that over the course of an hour,  zero sharks checked out the control board, zero checked out the slow blood pumping board, and exactly zero sharks checked out the fast one.  So this was by no means a perfect experiment. But I think it's safe to qualitatively say, that if no sharks came to checkout 15 drops of human blood a minutein the middle of shark infested waters, you're probably gonna be okay with a small scrape. I mean, there certainly won't be some kind of feeding frenzy with a single drop of blood from all sharks within a mile. Now that I had some firsthand data to put my mind at easeI was willing to try diving with the sharks without a cage,  but I had one final experiment. I had a theory that if we secured a 360 camerato the front of a hand spearand then shot it near some sharks we could create the world's first really cool matrixlike underwater bullet time effect. So I suited up and got in.  (upbeat music)- [Mark] This is terrifying.  And my theory proved correct on the bullet time hand spear.  Because as you can see, that footage turned out really cool. (upbeat music) (water gurgling) (upbeat music continues) Oh, he's got it!(upbeat music) (upbeat music continues) Oh gosh! Oh my gosh.  Holy crap! Oh gosh, I'm gonna die.  Save me Luke. They can sense I'm a newb. I know it. They know I'm a newb.  - [Luke] On that note, should we call it a day?   (chuckling)- [Mark] Let's end on that. That was amazing, man.  You got 'em in like a feeding frenzy at the end. There's like six of 'em all around us and I lived. I mean, this is shaping up to be a great day.  - What I'll take home from this shootis just more evidence of the amazing animal that sharks arebut also the ability to point people in a specific direction to say, \"Hey, your thoughts about them are a little overblown. \"- This experience definitely changedmy perception on sharks.  I would say I respect them moreafter seeing their raw power up close, but at the same time, there's less of that fear that comes from ignorance. On top of all that, I didn't die.  (energetic music) (energetic music continues) \n","(audience members yelling)- No steal. There's no steal there. I predict not a steal.  Watch this. And he stayed.  He's gonna steal. This is a steal. If this app works, this kid's about to steal. (excited vocalizing) There he goes!It fricking works. It works. Two years ago I came up with an idea for an appwhere you could decode baseball signs,  so you would know when the other teamwas going to steal even after just the first inning. Then in a covert effort to get people more interestedin coding and machine learning,  I would make the app free and available to everyone. I'm happy to report it's no longer just an idea. Today I'm gonna show you exactly how the app works and we'll use it in the wild. And then we're gonna talk about machine learningin very simple terms with my buddy Jabril. But first, to set the stage, we need to understand the fascinating world of secret baseball signs. It's the game within the game. Most people know the catcher will give signs to the pitcher when your team is on defense, but when you're on offense, the third base coach gives signsto both the batter and the base runner. For example, he could secretly tell the batter to bunt or to not swing at the next pitch. Or you can tell the base runner to steal. And just to be clear, stealing a base is when you start runningas soon as the pitch is thrown,  instead of waiting for the batter to try and hit it. It's risky because if the batter doesn't hit the balland the catcher's good, he can throw you out at second base.  Because it's a big advantage, coaches will actually tell their playersto watch and see if they could figure outthe other team's signs. That's considered a fair play and it's part of the game.  The problem is our brains aren't great at figuring outthe complex pattern. So we set out to create an appthat would use machine learning to do exactly that.  And by we, I mean Jabrilactually sat down and wrote the codeand I just made sure he had unlimited Cheez-Its and LaCroix. Here's how it works. If I saw coach touched his nose, ears, arm, chin and so on,  I would assign those to letters in the app. Then I would just watch him sign and record the order. After that, I would just let the app know the outcome.  So was it a steal or not?   After you do this for enough sequences, the app will start to make predictions. In this case, it's predicting the combination of AD or nose then chin is their steal sign. This worked well enough on my workbench, so now it was time for the first real world test in a kids versus adults Wiffle Ball game. And my friend Sarah takes the game of Wiffle Ballpretty seriously. So she was the captain of the kids teamand was signaling for them to steal at just the right moments. (everyone cheering) And I wasn't sure on the ethicsof using our app against a bunch of little kids, but they were scoring runs and stealing bases with impunityand then they got so confident,  they started talking trash. - [All] We want a pitcher not a belly itcher. - And no one says that about my pitcher, so at that point, the gloves came off.  We found it easiest to film her signs with our phoneand then scrub throughand capture the order in the app afterwards,  as opposed to trying to do it real time. And I'm very happy to reportwe cracked their code after only three sequences. (upbeat music) And what's cool is once you know the code, you no longer need the appbecause you can just watch for the steal signal. And when we saw it, we alerted our pitcher with the secret sign of our own.  (upbeat music) - Yeah. You're outta there buddy. - And after that, the tides of the game shiftedand we were able to officially prove adults rule and kids drool. So our app cracked the code after just three sequencesand I'm gonna show you them to see if you can figureout the steal sign using just your brain.  Here's the first one, and this was a steal. Here's the secondand this was no steal and this is the third and it was a steal pause and go back if you want to tryand figure it out because I'm about to tell you the answer.  According to the appwhich Sarah later confirmed their steal sign was onlyif she touched her hat and then left ear back to back.  Everything else was just a decoy. Now, before we tell you exactly how the app can figure thisout so quickly, we need a little background information.  So I've cornered my buddy Jabril hereand I'm gonna make him give us a super simple explanationof machine learning. Now here's what you should know about Jabril. He's basically a genius who taught himself how to code when he was 14.He has an amazing YouTube channelyou should check out with videoslike this one where he made a video game wherethe character teaches himself how to navigate any maze using machine learning and neural networks. - All right. Let's say we have Timmy hereand Timmy likes certain type of toys but not others.  So in our fake example here, he decides this basedon how big the toy is and how complicated it is. So from small to bigand then over here how many parts it has from just one piece to a really complex toywith gears and moving parts and things like that. And so if we asked Timmy about 20 different toys and start to plot those on the graphwe'll start to see a pattern. So generally he likes toys that are big and complicated but does not like toys that are small and simple. And so by looking at his past preferenceswe can make really good predictions for the future.  If you show little Timmy here a toy that is this complicatedand this big, we are confident that he'll like it before we even show itto him because it is inside the like boundary. That's the big deal with machine learning. We don't have to take the time and show little Timmy here every toy that's everbeen created and record his answers. After we record some likes and dislikeswe're able to draw some boundaries.  And precisely where we draw these boundariesis the secret sauce. In this case with just two inputsyou can just eyeball it and see where to put the boundaries.  But when you have thousands of inputs that interactwith each other, it's impossible for our brains tocomprehend where those boundaries should go.  However, it's pretty trivialfor a computer using machine learning. - In doing research for this video, I talked to probablyover 50 baseball players and coaches, and when we asked about signs, it was surprising to me how they all basicallyuse the same strategy. See if you could pick up on it. - Every coach has an indicator.  - I have an indicator so I could do all this, you know, random stuff like this, touch anywhere until I touch this. None of that matters. - So it'd be indicator and the next sign, that's a hot sign.  So it's indicator arm steal. If I just do the arm, that's nothing. - Oftentimes I'll give this,  Simon didn't say. If I go indicator, and then immediately to anywhere on my arm, steal. Bunt is to the belly indicator of the belly.  - So basically nothing mattersand it's all a decoy until they touch the indicator. And then the very next sign is the instruction. So after the indicator, you might be told to bunt or to take a pitch or to steal. And so since the steal sign comes immediatelyafter the indicator, we just lookat a sequence where steal was recorded here that's showing as one. Then we look through that sequence two lettersat a time and store those combos. And we do the same thingfor all the sequences where steal was recorded and whatever two letter combo shows upin all of them is their indicator and steal sign. In this case it's AD.  So if we decode that, that means nose is their indicatorand chin is their steal sign. Now I have a confession. What I just showed you doesn't use machine learning at all.  It's just a simple algorithm we realize would workonce we discover that pretty much all teamswill use an indicator directly before giving the real sign.  But based off all the people we talk toif you're trying to decode signsthis simple version should work like 90% of the time. But what about the other 10% where they do anything other than indicator followed by sign?   That's where you need machine learningbecause if done properlymachine learning can crack any code as long as you give it enough training data. So to really see how good Jabril's machinelearning app was, I generated some training data basedoff an insanely complicated steal sign I came up with to see if he could figure it out. So my secret sign was a mustache rubas the indicator followed by any random sign and then a tooth tap as the steal signthen I can have up to 50 different signalsin each sequence and then to throw 'em off even moreif I ever touch my right eyebrow, it's not a steal.  So you ignore everything in the sequenceeven if I've already given the steal sign. Now, just to set the stageif we weren't going to use machine learning this would take a normal computer thousandsof years to solve because it's the sameas if you're asking Timmy about every toy ever made, instead of just drawing the boundaries. Before we see if Jabril can successfully crack my code and how long it will take himlet's just go one layer deeper than the Timmy toy exampleand see how machine learning mimics the human brain in creating neural networks that can draw those boundaries, in the more complicated case of more than two inputs.  There are three main parts to a neural network. And hang with me here because I'm going to keep this simple. You have the input layer, whichin our case are the signs being given.  And then way over here you have the output layerin our case, steal or no steal. And then in the middle we have the hidden layers. And right now that's just a black box.  So if a sign was hat, hat, nose, handwe would tweak these input knobs like this. Depending on how each of these knobs is turned each one is interconnected with the knobs to its left. So it causes some simple math to occur at each node. And when you sum up all of those numbers you're left with a number between zero and one. And if that number is really close to zero, that's no steal. And if the number is really close to one, that's a steal.  So you give it a bunchof training data where given an inputyou know what the output should beand you start with these hidden layer knobs turnedin totally random directions and when you add them all up, you get something like 0.55.Well that doesn't make sense. You can't have half a steal. And more importantly with the training datayou know the answers and you know that this combination should have been a steal. So you just start tweaking these hidden layer knobsuntil you start to get outputs that are more correct over time. And after going through a bunchof examples where you know what the answer should beeventually you get to a point where any more tweakingof the knobs just makes it less accurate.  So you stop. So now you super glue these three hidden layer knobsinto place because you've trained your model. And so now with the brand new input where you don't know the answerit gives you the correct output. In this case, a steal. Of course, this is a simple modelbut this scales up so you could have thousands of inputs and thousands of outputs, and you'reable to discover really complicated relationships. What's so cool about this is this is basically how neural networks in our own brains are set up to learn. Once I've been given enough training data tounderstand the interaction between my handand arm and keeping something balanced like this then my model is trainedand I super glue those middle knobs in my brainthen I can introduce a totally new input I've never tried before and I still know what to do. I don't need to be trained on every possible different typeof object because my brain has drawn the boundaries.  Think about that. For a long time before machine learning and neural networkscomputers were just following hard-coded instructions givenby humans. Now they can learn like humans only they can do it much fasterand more comprehensively than we can. Obligatory. And that's why when I gave Jabril the challenge that would take a normal computer using brute forcemethods thousands of years to solve- Yo man, that's fast, please tell me that your indicator is a mustache rub. And then you have whatever.  And then a tooth tap. Is that it?   - That's it. Jabril's machine learning algorithm just created the right boundariesand solved it in less than three minutes. The machine learning model requires more datathan our simple versionwhich can solve it after like three sequences.  But the upside is that it will eventually decode any setof signs as long as you're capturing the inputs right. And so now it was time for a real life test.  So I asked my buddy Destin to do some secretive recon work. - Okay, dude, this is the field I used to play atgrowing up.  Today, my son is playing on the rascals. I'm gonna go film third base coaches doing their thingand we'll plug all that datainto the machine learning algorithm. These kids are yelling at me wanting me to know what my channel is. - And the fact they didn't recognize him just proved to methat whatever was happening in this region was a totallyeffective disguise. And thanks to Dustin's great interviews and raw footage we were able to get even more data to showthat our methods totally worked. And while Destin just brazenly set up a tripodand filmed all these third base coaches.  - Before you do that, you need to talk to 'em. Say, hey, this what I'm doing. - Yeah, 'cause signs are pretty secret, right?   - Yeah. - Oh yes. - Yes, sir. Got it.  I got in trouble for stealing signs. - I was a little more nervous and discreet. If you put a GoPro in a cup, you can actuallyjust watch the footage and frame the shot real time and it just looks like your checking dank memeswith a drink in your hand. I've actually used this trick a few timesespecially on my carnival scam science video.  So just like with Dustin's footage, it worked perfectlyat the games I went to, and it was just a cool feelingonce you'd cracked their code.  - Okay, steal, they're about to steal. To be able to predict exactly what was coming next. There he goes, there he goes.  Knew he was gonna steal. I knew it. I hope you enjoy this excuse to learn moreabout machine learning as much as I did.  I'll put links to both versions of the appin the video description for you to check out. And of course, if there are specific rulesagainst using technology to seal signs in your league I am not telling you to break them. Otherwise, from personal experience, you mightrisk getting some very important people mad at you. - You cheated, Mark Rova!   \n","(air hissing)- This is a rocket powered golf club. Professional golfers have an average swing speedof 110 miles per hour but using two F size motors she swings at 150 miles per hour every time. Usually for builds on my channel, I just show you guys the final thing and don't really talk about the process of how we got there. And rest assured today we will get to see huge drives.  Whoa. Golf balls shattering glass in super slow-mo, pulverized watermelonsand even a handheld version.  But this build I think is a great chanceto pull back the curtain and demonstratehow the engineering design process actually works. I want to highlight six learning opportunities that led us to this final design. And to do that, we need to go backin time four months to when I first had the ideaand as always we started with a simple prototype to see if the concept even had a remote chance of working. But before we fire it upyou'll notice we have counterweightson the opposite side here. That's so that the center of mass of the spinning part is on top of the axis of rotation. In other words, it balances perfectlyat the point at which it spins around. If you don't do that for something that spins,  it creates a bunchof extra force for your system to deal with. It starts as a small vibrationbut then it gets worse and worse as you pick up speed.  Since we need to hit this tiny ballwith the head of this club at really high speedsif we're not perfectly balanced, the cluband the whole platform itself would just be shaking all over the place and we'd never hit it. Okay, back to the test. (air hissing)Those stands are shaking more than they should. So we knew we would need to balance the spinning part better for the real test, but at least we knew it could go kindof fast and nothing blows up. And so then it was time for CAD, which is always the next step. And then together with my friends Ken and Kayla we started cutting metal and making stuff. (upbeat music)  Things came together well. So we epoxy a 3D printed motor mount to the topof the driver and prepped our first real test by taking oneof those easy ups and draping some nets on the side for safety just in casesomething went catastrophically wrong. (air hissing)  This was our second learning experience. We didn't have enough contact area for epoxying the headto the driver, so it wasn't a strong enough bond. This was tricky because it meant we hadto 3D scan the club head, which allowed us to CAD up.  And then 3D print a more contoured mountwith more contact area for the epoxy. We also took this chance to double the rocket holsters because what could possibly go wrong?   So we went to test our new dual rocket setupwith two e-motors and everything went perfectly. (air hissing) Except for the part where the head stamped off the driver. - [Kayla] That was not expected. - And when we reviewed the slowmo footagewhat we realized was the shaft of the driver is so flexible and it would start to bendand then create really weird thrust vectors for the rocketswhich then just bent the shaft even more. This is not what you wanna see.  Eventually this exceeded the stress limitof the shaft and the hedges came off. So our third learning opportunity wasto stiffen up the club shaft.  So we got some aluminum C channeland just dumped a butt ton of epoxy in there. And this worked remarkably well. You could see the difference here. And so with that, we headed outto a very remote shooting location in beautiful northern California. (upbeat music)So we finally arrived and started the setup.  But first I had something I wanted to get off my chest. So one of the things I like most about me is thatI like to reach out to lesser known channels and sort of give them a handout and some exposureon my channel, which is why today I'm here with Destin.  He's Smarter Every Day. And if by some miracle you don't know, Destin is on the Mount Rushmore of science YouTubers. We've been friends for almost exactly six years. And I know this because I took a screenshot of the huge moment for me when he subscribedto my channel when I only had 10000 subs. He's made videos about the physicsof cats landing on their feet, tattoos in super slowmo or the first video I saw of himabout how chickens have an internal open feedback loopwhich allows them to head track. If you've never seen his stuffI'm actually jealous because you have so many hours of high quality viewing in your near future. So I like golf. - I like rockets.  - Should we do this?   - Yeah, it's just, that was the intro, right?   - That was it. - Whatever. - So we all continued to set upand something that was important to me wasfor this to look as natural as possible at a driving range.  So we added some turf to cover the base plateand then dissected a golf bagto cover this sturdy steel column. And then if you add some clubs, it looks pretty awesome.  It's incredibly rigid, and yet it can still swing freely. Our fourth learning experience camefrom reviewing our final test footage. If you listen, the club goes faster and faster with each rotation. (air hissing)Naturally we want the club to contact the ballwhen it's going the fastest,  which in our case is 10 rotations in one second. That means we somehow need to sneak the ballinto the path of the driver in lessthan a 10th of a second or a quarter of an eye blink.  To accomplish thiswe have a pneumatic cylinder here that hinges up the tee. It knows when to fire because on the backof the shaft there's a light sensorand this disc has a slit which allows the light to pass through once per rotation. So we send that infoto an Arduino over here that counts for us. And then after 15 rotations, it tells the cylinder the precise moment to fire using a solenoid. And then we super glue the ballto the tee because it provides the Goldilocks amountof force to first secure and then release the ball.  Plus the super glue looks super dope in slowmo.  So now with everything in placewe started with two e-motors which as a reminderis the same setup that ripped the club head off. 3, 2, 1 roll.  (air hissing) Yeah!- Where did it go, what happened?   - Go baby.  - [Ken] That thing is past those trees. - No way. - Yeah. - [Ken] It took off.  - That's a cool shot right there, dude.   - Dude, this is respectable. This is legit. - [Mark] After reviewing more of the high-speed footage we noticed something interesting. - The sound effect there is like doing-doing. (laughs) - This was an interesting technical observation from Destinand that tee flexibility was causing usto hit some bad shots like this. An obvious fix is just to make the tee more rigid so that it doesn't over rotate when it pops up. But there's a problem with this. There's a saying that force follows stiffness. And for us, a really stiff tee would transfer a bunch of force and destroy our nice 3D printed pop-up mechanism. Now imagine this crumpled up piece of paper is the teewhich is obviously way less stiff.  Our flexible rubber tee was greatbecause it acted like this piece of paper. No matter how hard you hit itthe force doesn't get translated downand damage our hardware. So Ken had the brilliant idea of just tying a string to the tee and staking it into the ground. This stopped the over rotationbut everything was still just as flexible. - [Destin] When the string pulls tight,  does it make the ball fly off'cause it doesn't doink enough?   - Only way to test is a doink test. (Destin laughs)- Ah, beautiful.  - [Destin] There was some doinking. - I just thought this was a really simple, clever ideathat solved both problems at once. And as you can see, it worked perfectly.  Now we are ready to try a dual F motor.  So these deliver about twice as much force to the clubas the e-motors that made the head snap off. And this provided our final and certainly most poignant learning opportunity. One, go. (air hissing) - Where's the club?   (laughs)(air hissing) Where's the club?   (laughs)(air hissing) Where's the club?    (laughs) - Is the tree on fire?   - Wow, like I'm laughing, but that could've been bad.   There we go. This thing was like suborbital, dude. So we have three U bolts and we only used two. So I think we'll just max out those and just crank 'em way down. Now that we know this is a failure point. - Now that we know this is a failure point. There's several failure pointsand I hear you say, oh, we have a solution for that.  - This is the engineering design process. - It's rather fun. - Like I mentioned, the club that failed was cut too short and therefore only attach using two U-boltswhich we thought would've been enoughto support the 800 pound load from centrifugal force. We did notice the rubber handle was worndue to so many test fires, which probably initiated the stress concentration leading to the failure. So our fix was to cut the next club longerso we could use three U-boltsand really crank them down on a fresh rubber handle.  And so with all six of our learnings now in placewe tried the insane double F motors one more time. One, go.  (air hissing) Whoa, yeah, baby, go.  (cow mooing)That's how you play golf. - That's our best one yet, dude. - Like the rush you get from like an engineering achievement actually working is like. Oh, oh, oh, look at the plate, oh.  (air hissing) - So we never found these long ballsto measure the exact distance,  but I can drive a ball 280 yards. And these were well beyond that. I mean, just look at this trajectory, straight to outer space.  Now that we got all the shots we needed, it was time to have some real fun. We started with a handheld version that was poweredby a single c-motor because anything morethan that would just be way too unsafe for me to hold.  (air hissing)  - Nice. - (indistinct) 300 yards, man. It really did like make it so much easier to swing.  I'm not even kidding, yeah, yeah, yeah. Like it really made a difference. Three, two, and then some glass just because.  (air hissing)(glass breaking) Yeah.  (glass breaking) And then keeping with the tradition of my channel, some watermelon. (air hissing)     Thanks for cutting open a watermelonwith a rocket powered golf club, Mark. - You're welcome. Yeah, that's all of this. The past three monthsof working engineering was just- - Boils down to this moment?   - Just to enjoy this watermelon. - Yeah, Mark's like trying to make stuff look good. We're not wasting food though. - We waste no part of the engineering effort like the great Indians with the buffalo. So Destin made a video on his channelabout why some balls bounce high and others don't. And my first thought was, well, that's easy.  It just has to do with how compressible or rubbery it is. Yet this billiard ball is pretty much completely solidand this bouncy ball is pretty rubbery and yet they bounce to pretty much the same height. So it's something else. As you can imagine, this is a pretty important pieceof information for golf ball makers. So he has lots of amazing slow-mo footage of golf balls being squished in ways that hurt your brainplus way more footage from today's shoot. So I will leave a link in the video descriptionand while you're there, make sure to check out some of his other videos and subscribe to his channel'cause he's just a classy individualand a true professional in every sense of the word. - Are you rolling?   - Yeah.  - Hey, it's me, Mark. (upbeat music)  \n","- About a year ago, I read about this powderyou could add to super muddy water like this, and then you stir it up, and five minutes later,  the mud has separated from the pure, clean, drinkable water. And as a man of science, I see this and it feels like nothing short of magic.  I only make 12 videos a year, so I am really picky about what topics I will cover.  And even though I usually just focus onusing science and engineeringto make totally ridiculous things.  (people screaming)At least once a year, I try to make the casethat these same science and engineering principles are also being usedto actually change the world for the better. For example, last year I met with Manu Prakash from Stanfordwho was disappointed to realize the typical microscope and centrifugeto diagnose malaria costs tens of thousands of dollarsand needs to be plugged in.  So he amended a paper microscope and a paper centrifugethat costs 68 cents that can diagnose malaria and require no electricity. So today, we're gonna find out how this was invented, how the heck it works, and how it's being used to help people all around the world.  But first, to demonstrate this isn'tsome kind of smoke and mirrors trick, I located the nastiest water I could find near my house and met up with some intrepid field scientists. Today I'm joined by my friends, Cole, Kayden, Rainie and Max,  I promised them they could be in a videobut I didn't tell 'em which one or what we'd be doing, and here's the deal, guys. We need to go into that pond that's all gross and nasty and fill it up with muddy water, can you do that?   (upbeat music)  Do you guys think this would be good to drink this?   - [Children] No. - What do you guys give me if I take a sip of this?    - 20 bucks. - 20 bucks?    Okay. We're not gonna do anything to this onebut I'm gonna do something to this one so then we can compare the two, okay?   So I'm gonna take a little bit of this powder, I'm gonna put it in here. You guys see this?    And then we're gonna take turns shaking itfor like five minutes, okay?    - See. - Let's see what happens. - Looks better.  - It looks normal. - That looks better. - It looks better.  Yeah, that looks really better. Oh, that looks like. - Okay, I'm gonna put my thumb at the water level so you know I'm not tricking you guys, okay?   - Ew.  - Ew. - Ah, that's some high quality H2O right there.  All right, where's my 20 bucks, Rainie?   - Mommy. - Chances are, if you're watching this video, you have essentially an endless supply of clean water at the pull of a lever. And because this is so easy, we tend to forget just how critical water is for us.  You can live three weeks without foodbut only a few days without water. And it's not just us, from plants to ants to bacteria,  anything that is biological and livingneeds water to survive. It sounds crazy, but there are no exceptions to this rule.  Because of this, when NASA is lookingfor evidence of life outside our planet,  we first start by looking for evidence of water. Given all that, it's a total bummerthat nearly 1 billion people around the world don't have access to clean drinking water. Today, drinking contaminated water causes more deathsthan HIV, AIDS and malaria combined.  And so, that's why the powder in this packetis a really big deal. It was invented by a guy named Philip Souter,  he's a laundry scientist at Procter & Gamblewho was originally trying to figure out a wayto separate dirt from used laundry water.  And I wanna be clear here, they are not sponsoring this video in any way. I just think what they're doing is really awesomeand they deserve some credit.  So I was actually able to track Philip downand he told me all about how it worked. - So essentially, there's three processes, there's coagulation,  then the next phase is flocculation, and then the last piece is the disinfection. - You start with clean water like this but now it's all brown because it's filled withlots of dirt, particles, parasites, and bacteria. So you dump the powder in the water, and as Phil explained,  the coagulant part of the powder goes to work first. It's basically seed crystals that are positively charged, and because the dirt in the water is negatively charged,  these seed crystals act like dirt magnets. These dirt magnets growuntil they're each about a millimeter in size.  The next part of the powder to activate is the flocculant, which is a polymer, which you can think aboutas having huge long arms that wrap up all the little dirt magnet clumps, and now they form bigger chunks as large as a centimeter. And these chunks now are so big,  they're just slightly more dense than the water, which means they sink to the bottom. And finally, the chlorine is released and it goes to work on killingthe 99. 9999% of all the really tiny viruses and bacteria that are left in the water that didn't get wrapped upand sink to the bottom. So now you're just left with safe drinking water at the top. And this isn't just some PR stump for P&G.  Since 2004, millions of people in over 90 countrieshave used these packets and they've saved untold thousands upon thousands of lives. In fact, they've cleaned enough waterto fill a swimming poolthat is the typical five feet deep by 15 feet across,  only the length would need to stretchall the way across the United States over 13 times.  These packets cost them pennies to makewhich they sell at a lossand that feels like the right thing to do. But it brings up the question,  is there a case to be made beyond altruismwhere it's in the best interests of the rich countriesto help out the poor countries?    And to answer this question, I wanted to speak with someone in the technology sectorwho had some experience in this kind of thing, and he's a bit of an obscure up and comer named Bill Gates.  But first, I had to do a little bit of researchin order to get myself up to Seattle.  (bright music) And when I arrived, they told meI was free to make myself at home while I waited for him to show up. So I did what any rational person would dogiven the circumstances, I made the richest man on planet Earth some pizza rolls.  (bright music continues)- Hi. - Bill, good to meet you. - Yeah, thanks for doing this. - They gave me free reign over your kitchen,  and as a token of hospitality, I whipped up a batch of pizza rolls. - Oh wow, I'll try it, it's not what I normally eat.  It's pretty hot, actually. - They're kind of like lava in the middle. - Not bad. - It's a bit okay, right?    - All right, yeah. - A little bit of cardboard. - What do you got here?   - This was plan B 'cause I wasn't expecting youto actually eat one of those. - Okay.  - Dick's burgers. - Love Dick's. - I know you love-- It's a Seattle phenomena. - Truth be told, I actually knew this after seeing a picture of him on Reddit. He's standing in line by himselfto buy one of their hamburgers for less than two bucks. Hate to disappoint you, there's no Dick's burgers in here.  - Okay. - We have some liquid refreshment. - That's pretty dark looking.  - So I took out the powderand explained to him how it worked, and then I set up the bottles. And here's where we stood after a minute or two. - Looks like we're making some progress up at the top there. - We're making some progress. - I'd rather eat these than that so far. - Why should we care about developing nations?    - Well, the amount of resourcethat rich countries spend in helping poor countries is pretty small, it's well less than 1% of their budget. I defend that because that money is so impactful,  you're saving livesfor less than a thousand dollars per life saved. If you help a country lift itself up,  then countries like Indonesia, Vietnam, India, get successful enough, they grow their economy so they no longer need it, they graduate. - Okay, look at this. - So it's amazing the way that a small amount of this thing. - Isn't it crazy?   It's like magic. And I liked his answer that basically teaching a man to fish is better than just giving a man a fish. What about the extreme case of a personwho's just super self-absorbed, who might think, I just don't care if a poor country has a fish or not,  it doesn't affect my daily life. I asked what he would say to that person. - The benefits are strong even if the pure humanitarian empathetic partisn't the key reason.  - So then Bill told me two main reasonswe should try and help developing nations, even from a selfish standpoint. The first is for our own safety.  If a poor country receives aid, it fosters education and economic opportunity, which makes it more stable.  And there's less of a reason for people to become desperate, which is a breeding groundfor radical ideologies and terrorism.  All America's top generals agreethat foreign aid creates stability, which reduces the need for military spendingand makes the world a safer place.  Additionally, Bill told me there's the issue of diseases. When the next pandemic comes, there's a good chance it will be far worse than Ebola and it will spread quickly into the rich countries. There's a huge benefit to usin helping these developing nations get their health systems to the pointwhere they can detect and treat bad stuffbefore it has the chance to go global. And the second selfish reason for helping developing nationsthat we discussed together was for our own prosperity. - After World War II, you think, hey, do we care about Japan?    Well, hey, then Japan, you know, Sony and Toyota, they're making good products. - Nintendo. - Yeah, let's not forget Nintendo.  It's a win-win situation, you know, where we want Japan to do well and make great products. And you know, they're buying Boeing jets, Microsoft software.  - Hypothetically. - Hopefully. The idea that other countries doing well,  it's not a zero sum thing, where, okay, if they do well, that means that it's bad for us.  - Basically, we needed to get the Japanese back to a pointwhere their brains could benefit the world againas quickly as possible.  Otherwise, it's a waste of human capitaland the world never knows \"Super Mario Brothers\". Which raises an interesting point. If you ask people,  who is the most intelligent person to ever live?   You get various answers like these. - Albert Einstein. - Einstein. - Einstein.  - Albert Einstein. - Albert Einstein. - Einstein- Albert Einstein. - Mark Rober.  - Did I tell you to say that?   What?    You!But the fact is, with 100 billion peopleto have ever lived on planet Earth,  it's a statistical certaintythat Albert Einstein wasn't the most intelligent human. It was some random person you've never heard of,  probably born a long time agowho spent most of their daily energy just trying to survive. And that's why these packets are a huge deal.  When you have nearly 1 billion peoplespending their timejust trying to find clean water every day, that's a huge waste of untapped brain power.  Now these packets and other aid efforts like themallow parents to stay healthyand gives them time to provide for their families,  which gives their kids the opportunity to get educated, which in turn creates more opportunitiesfor the following generation.  And so, eventually, over time, the entire world starts reaping the benefitfrom the contributionof this previously untapped human capital.  And in this way, some massive breakthroughin solar technology or maybe the cure to cancer or HIV might come from a poor countrywho is just a developing nation today, and I find that to be incredibly inspiring and a worthy goal. - You know, I get to learn a lot, you know, I'm gonna be working on these diseases the rest of my life.  - Bill Gates, living legend, eater of pizza rolls. - Yeah, not bad. - That was fantastic,  thanks so much, Bill. Now we drink. (bright music continues)\n","- This guy took a package from my porchand now he's about to open it in his car. But what he doesn't know is this is a custom built bait package that is recording him on four different camerasand it's about to unleash a pound of the world's finest glitteralong with some other surprises. But to understand how we got to this point, first, we need to rewind a bit.  About seven months ago, I noticed a package being reported as delivered, but it never arrived. So when I checked our security camerasI noticed this lovely couple out for a stroll.   As you can see, they have backpacks on and they're just going around the neighborhoodmaking an afternoon out of this. And if you've ever been in a situation like this,  you just sort of feel violated. And then I took this to the police and even with the video evidence, they said, it's just not worth their time to look into, so then you also feel powerless.  And I just felt like something needs to be doneto take a stand against dishonest punks like this.  And then I was like, hold up, I built a dartboard that moves to get a bullseye every time.  I spent nine years designing hardwarethat's currently roving around on another freaking planet.  If anyone was going to make a revenge bait packageand over-engineer the crap out of it, it was going to be me.  So I started with a sketch and some CADand then I hit up my buddy Sean, who is really good with this type of small electronics stuff and we got to work. Ultimately, when they opened the package,  I just wanted to celebrate their choice of professionwith a cloud of glitter because I mean,  who doesn't love glitter?   That's easy, I could just do that passivelywith like a spring when it opens.  But I also wanted to record their reaction, and that's what makes the engineering here an order of magnitude more difficult. Because if you think about it, this thing has to sit on a porch all day and it can't be plugged in, and you have no idea when someonewill come and pick this up. So it's not like you could just hit record on the camera and then put it in the boxbecause you're gonna run out of battery and storage space.  On top of that, I need some way to recover this footagein case I never get the bait package back. So after six months and lots of design iterations,  and so much testing, here's where we landed.  (upbeat music) This custom printed circuit boardis the brains of the operation. It has a built-in accelerometer, and when it it's jostled it will check the GPS signal to see if it's been moved from the porch. And if so, it sends a signal to all the phones to wake up and start recording. And I'm using four phonesthat have a wide angle filming mode and are angled back.  And this 3D printed portion is contoured this waybecause it represents the field of view of the phones.  So as you can see, I'm guaranteed to capture their reactionno matter which way they open it from.  And nestled in here, we've got a can of fart spray. No joke, you can clear a room with one spray of this stuff.  So we made a cam on a small motor that sprays it five times.  And not only is this just a nice touch, but we keep repeating five sprays every 30 seconds,  until they throw the package out of their car or housebefore they realize there's four phones inside.  This increases our chances of finding it, because we always know the package location at all times due to the GPS on the phones. But even if we don't recover it, all four phones have LTE data plans.  So they upload the footage to the cloudso I can still see what happened. And then for the pièce de résistance,  we have a cup here on top that spinsfrom a motor underneath.  So once you load in a butt tonof the world's finest glitter, the motor spins really fastand the centrifugal force fires it evenly in all directions.  Then we cut holes in the side of the lidand cover them with one-way film,  so two of the cameras could see them as they walked away. And then finally, to make it look likean actual delivered package,  we added some shrink wrap and a delivery label, which is perhaps my favorite part of the whole thing.  Because if the thief wasn't in such a hurry, they'd see that the package is actually coming from my childhood hero and in inspiration for this project, Kevin McCallister.  (screams)- Yes.  - I even looked upand am using the address of the actual housethey filmed the movie in, and of course it's being shipped to his boys,  Harry and Marv. And there's a charge port in the bottom because if it doesn't get stolen in any given day, I can bring it in and then recharge all the batteriesin the system overnight.  So the idea is the bad guycomes and takes it off your porch, then lifts the lid, and these two limit switches tell the circuit board brain insidethat the lid's been removedand then that sets everything in motion.  And I may be biased, but sometimes a well-engineered design is beautiful.  (upbeat music)     And because the phones have GPS, we created a virtual geofence around my house so I get a notificationwhen the package has been moved off the property. So I put it down on the porch and now all that was left to do was wait. (clock ticking) Okay, so I was at work and I got a notificationthat the geofence we set up had been tripped.  So then I checked the cameras and sure enough, the package is gone. So I checked the GPS and sort of tracked it and it appears they're in a carbecause they seem to leave my house pretty quickly,  but it seems to have stopped in a parking garage, which is where I'm headed to now.  And if you're new here, this isn't a prank channel, so I am completely out of my comfort zone. (clock ticking) And there she is.  Oh.  Oh, I see some glitter. This is like recovering the black box of a crashed airplane.  It would still work even if I didn't get the box back, the footage would upload to the cloud,  but it's just faster to plug the phones in. So I'm gonna go home and find outhow this somehow ended up here.  So it appears he was walking down the sidewalk and then suddenly makes a hard left. Then he takes the package and gets in his car and eventually makes it to this parking garagewhere this glorious sequence unfolds.   - [Man] What the fhaaaaa-No way.   (beep) Look at that, dude, look at my car, dude, everything.   Oh my God, I don't know what this is.  It's literally like everywhere.  - [Man] Bro. (motor spinning) What the (beep) Come on. - [Thief] Bro, leave that (beep) outside. - [Man] What the (beep) is that smell (beep)?   Open the door.  (laughter)- [Man] What the (beep)?    (motor spinning)- [Thief] Get that (beep) outta here, you shouldn't have even grabbed that (beep).  - [Man] What the (beep)?   - [Thief] Get that (beep) outta here. - [Man] What do you want me to do (beep)?   - [Thief] Throw it away.  That stinks.  - [Man] You (beep) on yourself?   Take this (beep) up out of here, (beep), for real.  Oh. Take that (beep). Take the whole thing.    (motor spins)  - [Voice] Keep the change you filthy animal.    (motor spinning) - [Mark] So the moral of the story isjust don't take other people's stuff.  Not only is it not cool, but on the plus side, you'll never find yourself in this situation.  Or perhaps even worse, this one. - [Man] My girlfriend's gonna get in here like, who you had in here?    (impact)\n","- Why do horns and musical instruments have this flared shape?   To answer this question, about a year ago, I decided I would take this, and scale it up to this.  And I've never actually made something this bigfor my channel before.  So as usual, we decided to make a smaller prototype modelto see what we could learn about the challengesthat would come from scaling it all the way up.  So we started by creating a plaster moldwith the right curvature. Then you cover that with a gel coat,  and then we put three layers of fiberglassand polyester resin. And then when you pop it out of the mold,  you're left with this. We were immediately struck that there is in fact, something really special about this shape.  So I'm gonna switch over from my lav micto my shotgun mic for this demo. Here's my voice normal.  Here's my voice with the tubeto show that there's more going on herethan just focusing the sound in one direction.  And then here's my voice using the horn. You can even hear me whisper, which is creepy.  But if I was without it at the same volume, you can't really hear it.  So this was proof that the curved shape of the hornhad a significant effect on amplifying the input sound.  But I still wasn't sure why. So now it's time to really scale things upto the big monster horn, which we did by applying all the same principles we learned on the prototype. And then we headed to the most desolate locationwe could find on Google Maps to put it together.  (upbeat music)  (upbeat music continues)  (upbeat music continues)  (upbeat music continues)- [Dan] Can you hear me?    (Mark laughing)Hello, over there.  - It feels like you're right on my shoulder. As you know, the base of the horn is what's responsible for creating all the sound. So to see what's inside, I thought it was only appropriateto open it with my friends, Dan and Lincoln,  from the popular YouTube channel, \"What's Inside?   \"And it turns out it's pretty simple.  The key is this thin metal circular plate, or diaphragm. So the air comes in here at 100 PSI and passes around this diaphragm in such a waythat it causes it to vibrate 110 times in a second,  which causes a corresponding pressure waveto shoot out here and down the throat of the horn.  So after a few hours, everything was finally set up, and it was the moment of truth. Since after eight months, none of us had actually ever heard it fire yet.  And Lincoln hadn't even seen the thingbecause we made him wait in the car. This is the big reveal. You ready?    - Yeah. - One, two, here it is. (horn honking)Is that pretty loud?    - Wow! That's so cool!- Is that pretty good?    - Yeah. - This actually isn't the horn. It's that. - Oh. - Behind you. Now you can look.  - Oh, my!- But before we fire it, we need to first talk about how hearing worksand what I eventually learned about why horns have that curved shape. Let's say this jello block representsa volume of air molecules.  If that horn diaphragm hits the jello molecules over here, there's a chain reaction of jello moleculescrashing into each other until finally,  you see movement on the other side of the jello block. And this is where your eardrum is.  So it moves back and forth at the same rateas the horn diaphragm, because of all of these collisions of the jello molecules in between. This is called a pressure waveand it's how sound travels through air. And so if the horn diaphragm is hitting the air molecules at a high frequency, or very frequently, our brain decodes that as a high pitch.  But if the crashes are happening at a low frequency, or less frequently, then our brain decodes that as a low pitch.  Okay, but why the curvy horn shape?   Well, that has to do with something called impedance matching. Basically, the horn diaphragm is very solid and strong. And it pushes against the air,  which doesn't offer much resistance. It's not very effective, like trying to break a piece of paper by punching it.  So without the curvy horn portion, as the diaphragm moves back and forth,  it interfaces with the air, sort of like this. You can still see the jello's moving on the opposite side,  just not that much because the air is just too thinand weak over this small of an area. So to have a better interface with the air,  you put a big curvy shape right after the diaphragm. You can see now your eardrum is moving back and forth much more vigorouslybecause the interface is so much better. So it sounds louder with a curved horn,  not because you're amplifying the sound, but because you're conserving the sound. This makes sense,  because amplifying means you're adding power to the systemand there's no battery or plugsat the curved section of a horn.  It's passive. So by impedance matching, you give yourself a much larger areato push against all the air at the outlet,  which makes for a more effective chain reactionof molecules crashing into your eardrum.  And now the horn. (horn honking)Is that pretty loud?   - Wow! That's so cool!- Is that pretty good?    - Yeah. - This actually isn't horn. It's that.  - Oh. - Behind you. Now you can look. - Oh, my!(horn honking) - What?    - Oh my gosh! This is like eight months of work. That's the first time we've actually fired off.  And that's behind the horn. - I could feel the vibrations.  - Yeah!- We're not even in front of the thing. - We're gonna go see what it's like on the other side. All right. So this is,  we're about two football fields away from the horn. We have no idea how loud this is gonna sound here.  All right, Ken, fire the normal air horn. (airhorn honking)Yeah, we could hear it. Now we're a little nervous.  'Cause you could hear it decently well. - All right, firing. (horn honking) (group laughing)- So for our second test, we drove about a mile away. And you can barely see the horn right here.  All right, Ken, fire. (horn honking) - No!- We can still completely hear it. - Yes! - That's crazy. - I mean, you could hardly see that massive horn.  But it's still super loud. So let's just drive. - Just keep going. - All right, let's go. - We're gonna go real far. So from a satellite view, this is where the horn was.  Here was the first spot, and then the second spot. And then here was the third spot.  Two and a half miles away. Okay. So the horn is now super far away.  I literally can't see it with my naked eye. - It's so far away. I can barely see it. It's right at the crest of the hill.  There's a little tiny speck and it's right there. - We're gonna do an experiment, and we're gonna test the speed of sound.  We should hear it on this walkie-talkie. And then some amount of time later, we might be able to hear it from this distance.  Lincoln's gonna measure the time on his stopwatch, and then we should be able to calculate from there what the speed of sound is. We're ready when you are. - [Ken] Okay. I'm ready.  (horn honking) - Wait for it.  (horn honking) That's crazy! How long?   It took 11 seconds for the sound of the horn to get here.  - We can still hear it so clearly. - It's so clear!Like I feel like we could go 10 miles further.  Think about what this means. It took an unbroken chainof two and a half miles of air molecules, 11 seconds to all collide with each other until they made it all the way down hereand bumped into the air molecules in our ear canals,  which then bumped into our eardrums. - [Lincoln] Hi! Wait, what if I scream?    (Lincoln screaming)- [Mark] So the sun was quickly going down,  but before we went home, we wanted to try and break some glass. And if you want to break glasswith what is essentially little puffs of air,  the trick is to find out its resonant frequency. You actually know all about thisif you've ever used one of these.  I can make Eliza go really high with just a little force.  Now, if I apply that force at random intervals, it doesn't do very much. It's not fun, huh?    No, it's not fun.  But if I apply that force equal to the timingof the natural frequency of the swing, those little pushes add to each other.  - Go higher, Mark Rova!- And so in this case, the resonant frequency increased our fun.  But if engineers don't take this into consideration, it could lead to disaster, such as when wind gusts going at just the right rate,  destroyed the Tacoma Narrows bridge. It's also why soldiers don't march in unison when crossing a bridge. So if you measure the natural frequency of the glasswith an accelerometer like this,  then you just need to make sure your horn firesat that exact frequency, or a multiple thereof. Or you can just change the natural frequency of the glass to match your hornby adding weights in the right spot. (glass shattering)   (upbeat music)    - Go higher, Mark Rova! - You're so fun!\n","- Fruit Ninja. (ethereal music)  (screaming)- [Rick] In half. - [Mark] The idea that a human beingcan throw a plane card with this kind of power and accuracy is insane to me. Look at that!And while throwing cards isn't necessarily my strong suit. . . (laughter)I can design and build stuff. So I made the world's first deadly powerfulplaying card machine gun. So I'm gonna give you a quick overviewof the design and performance of my machine.  (ding) (machine gun shooting)And then to really test it out, I'm gonna go head to head, man versus machinein a series of challenges against the best card thrower in the world. Here we go. So to start off, you load a deck of cardsin the bottom right here and then there's really two parts to the gun. First, you wanna slide the cards forward, one at a time from the top of a deck underneath.  That's what this belt and pulley are for. (machine gun whirring)And by turning this variable resistorwe can adjust the feed speed.  And then for the second part, you've got this main wheelwith O-Ring stretched aroundthat's attached to this brushless DC motor.  The cards are pushed under the wheeland it contacts on the left side, and it spins them out underneath like this.  It works because there's a gap under the spinning wheelthat's just barely smaller than the thicknessof a single card. And to build it as usual, first we started in CAD,  then machine the main body out of aluminum C channel. After that, it was just a matter of putting it together and running a lot of tests. And so this is what it looks likerunning in single shot mode,  and then machine gun mode, (machine gun whirring) and then Robin Hood mode.  And perhaps my favorite part is if you want extra stabilityyou just push this button. Think I'm happy enoughwith how it's performing at this point.  So now it's time for the real test. And to do that, I tracked down a manwho could throw a playing card through just about anything.  Rick Smith Jr. So how many world records do you hold Rick?    - I hold three Guinness Book World Records. Throwing a playing card the farthest72 yards, 92 miles an hour.  The highest and considered the most accurate. - All right. So in order to objectively testhow good this really is,  I am challenging the best the human race has to offer. Three rounds, man versus machine. - Let's do this. - This is like a metaphor. - Yeah, it is. - How do you feel with all of humanity's hopes and dreams resting squarely on your shoulders?   - Really worried on this. This is pretty impressive. - I will say it looks, I think a little more intimidating than it is this. Is this highly over-engineered?   - Is it?   - No. - No, I don't think so. - Let's go. - All right.  (electronic music) - Okay, round one,  man versus machine. - Okay. - How many cards could you getin the styrofoam in six seconds?   - Six seconds?    - Got plenty of strength. - I got this. - This is a machine gun. Start. (cards tapping)  And time. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. - Nine in six seconds.  I'll time you, ready?    - What?   - I didn't wanna introduce this yet. Just right out of the gate, but. . .  - What is that?   Go! (machine whirring)  - Yeah!- Eight, nine, 10, 11, 12.  - [Mark] Even though I beat him in thefirst of our three rounds,  Rick said he'd show me a few of his trick shots. (hip hop music)   (laughter)(hip hop music)     Round two. - You ready?   - Right now I just wanna sayMachines one, humanity zero.  - Well, this is about accuracy. Is your machine accurate as it is fast?   - Even more accurate than it is fast.  - I'll prove that, I'll prove that to you. I throw the olive up, one chance. - One chance. Slice it clean through it. - I got it.  - Oh! - Whoa!(Mark laughing)(ethereal music)  - Clean through.  Wow! - [Rick] Completely in half. - Am I nervous?   No. (laughter) All right, time for the machine. - [Rick] Let's go!(machine gun whirring) - I mean, that was close. - This is not close at all.  - There's gotta be something there. - You switched the olives. - I did not. - You're a magician. Whatever. - Fine.  One to one, I guess. - Oh my God, that scared me! (glass breaking)(glass breaking) (light bulb buzzing)(ethereal music) (laughter)   - I want you to think of a playing card. Any playing card, we've been playing with cardsall day long. - We have, yep. - Awesome, name that card now.  - Ace of spades. - That's a common card, you sure you want that card?   - Yeah. - All right. This is an ace of spades?   - That's my business card I don't know why that's in there. But you really want the ace of spades?   You could change it if you'd like. - I do wanna change it.  Well, you're changing it?   All right, what are you changing it to?   - Three of clubs. - I knew he would. Look at this.  Look, look, look, look, look. You look through the cards like this slowly. - No. - Look, look, look. You'll see that one cardand one card only is different.  Happens to be the three of clubs. - Stop! - Was that it?    - What?   ! - So cool.  - My mind is broke!I hate you so much. - I'm so sorry. - The world is no longer true.  It's witchcraft!And to help calm my very troubled mindbefore the final showdown,  I decided we should blow some stuff up. - You guys ready?   (balloon pops) - [Mark] Yeah!(balloon pops)(chill music)     - And the physics at play here is pretty straightforward.  If you've ever put your hand out the window of a caryou know what happens if you barely angle it up or down. So to fly fast, you wanna be perfectly leveled.  There's the sweet spot right in the middle. When I covered the science ofthe perfect rock skip in another video, we talked about how spinning things are more stable because of Newton's first law. So Rick really flicks his wristto maximize the card rotation,  which keeps it stable and level, slicing through the air much longerthan anyone else on the planet.  All right, Rick Smith Jr. - All right, Mark Rober. - This is the last competition. - Okay, what are we doing?   - [Mark] First one to stick in the watermelon wins.  - That should be easy, one try. - There is the one catch. The cool little twist is you have to shoot under the waterfall. Okay?   - Alright, so you're gonna give us a countdown?   - I'll countdown. This is it, man versus machine.  Is it this over-engineered NASA piece of junkor the collegiate baseball throwing Guinness World record card thrower?   Place your bets in the comments below. Just don't forget to take this into consideration.  - When I count to three. - On three. - Yep. One,  two. . .  No, I'm out! - You're out! - [Mark] And so while the robot uprisingis undeniably marching closer every day,  at least for the time beingRick Smith Jr.  has our back. If you want to learn how to throw cards like Rick Smith Jr. ,  he actually put up a tutorial video on his channel. It's actually a super teachable skillbecause I started out like this.  (laughter)And less than five minutes later I was doing this. (cheering) So go check that out and sub his channelfor more cool magic and card trick shots. Rick, could we go maybe a little thinneron those slices, pal?    (upbeat dubstep music) (machine whirring)  Through just about anything.  I'm too fast for you dog. I'm too fast for you. \n","- I saw this video on Twitter with over 5 million views, and then again on YouTube with nearly 1 million views. Basically, this guy modified his cell phone case with propellers to take selfies, which is awesome. My only issue with it is that it's not only fake,  but it's a scam, which I'll explain in a minute. But as for it being fake, the first clue is that these are three-volt,  seven-millimeter microbrush motors like you see here. If you attach one to a beam like thisand turn it on at full throttle, you'll see the most weight that it can lift is six quarters, or about 30 grams. The cell phone in the video with all the flying gear attached would weighabout 300 grams, and since drones are typically designedto hover at 70% max thrust,  you would need at least 15 of these motorsto do what he did. But you know, this just doesn't look as catchy. In fact, we recreated the exact setup he used in the video and turned the motors to full throttleand this is what happened. Here it is in slow-mo, and as you can see,  there's hardly any difference than if you don't turnthe propellers on at all. So I'm gonna show you how this scam artist somehow manages to break the laws of physics four more timesin this three-minute video. And then because obeying the laws of physics isn't optional,  we're gonna call up fellow YouTuber Captain Disillusionto see if he can help a spot any signs of special effects. And then with my buddy Peter Sripol,  I'm gonna show you what it would taketo actually build a flying selfie phone case,  and then I'll put all the detailson a new site I built using wix. com. But before I do any of that, let me first explain why this is a scam and not just a harmless fake videofor meaningless internet points. With this many views and an astounding 80% like ratio,  which means most people probably didn't realize it was fake, it's a statistical certaintythat some young, aspiring engineer actually tried to build this themselves. Worse than their parents' phone dropping like a rockand breaking, this might have been his or her first experience at making something. But how, you might ask, would they know what components to use?   Well, here in the description,  Amazing maker was kind enough to put links, Amazon affiliate links. You can tell by the URLs.  So he is making money off the crest dreamsof aspiring engineers without enough experience yet to know that this is total BS, and aspiring engineers are my peopleand you don't mess with my people.  (gun cocks)Let's do this. (gun fires)The second gratuitous violationof physics comes in this scene. Force of gravity always points down,  but helicopter spinning blades create a force perpendicularto the blades themselves. So if you want to hover, you need to be level so the forces will cancel out and you won't move. If you tilt forward and then break the thrust forceinto its x and y components,  you suddenly have an unbalanced force that will move youin that direction. In essence, that's how helicopters move forward,  by tipping forward. In other words, it's physically impossibleto hover in an orientation like this. The forward thrust component is unbalanced,  and it would have to move the phone forward. The third major issueis the Arduino-compatible circuit board he chose.  It's the same board here, and it's supposed to be the brains for the drone. Yet this specific model of board doesn't comewith any sort of gyroscope or accelerometer.  Here's why that matters. If you've ever tried balancing something on your handlike this, you and your body were creating what's referred to as a closed loop feedback control system. So if it starts to tip over, my eyes relay that to my brain and my hand says,  \"Hey, I'm no longer feeling the weight just up and down. It's also pushing my hand this way. \" And so my brain takes all that informationand responds by telling my hand to move this wayat a specific speed in order to compensate.  So to keep this thing balanced, there's this continuous loopof quickly gathering information, and then making real-time adjustments.  And closed feedback loops are used all over in engineering, from the simple case of a thermostatthat continuously checks the air and turns on at a certain temperature, to dartboards that updatetheir position 200 times a secondto get a bullseye every time.  (bell dings)To machines that are abused, and most certainly for anything that flies and needsto stay in the air.  The fact that his board is missing a gyroscopeand an accelerometer means there's no way for it to tellif it's starting to rotate or to fall in any direction.  It's the equivalent of trying to balance the boardwearing a blindfold and an oven mitt. You have no idea what adjustments to make to keep things balanced. (cat meows)Which is the perfect lead-into the fourth major physics flaw. Notice how he attaches these motors and rigidly fixes them to the phone with double-stick tape. This means if you start to tip forward, you have no way to self-correct the phone orientation,  and it would just turn into a nose dive. If you only have two propellers in this configuration, they both need to be able to rotate with respect to the phone in order to correct for movementsin all six degrees of freedom. For example, if it starts to tip forward, you could rotate them both back like this to correct for that. Or if the wind is trying to spin the phone this way, they could assume this configuration to counter that.  To return to our balancing shovel analogy, by fixing the motors directly to the case, you lose your ability to even make corrections.  So not only do you have no idea where to move, but your arm is locked out from making adjustments anyways,  which makes it literally impossible to balance. (shovel clangs)Ow.  And my final physics issue with this videois one of acoustics. This guy proposes using it as a hands-free wayto watch your favorite, super hip music videos,  conveniently dubbing over the audio here. (upbeat music)(singers singing in foreign language)For reference, this is what an episode of \"The Office\" would sound like on a phone at full volume. (actor talking)(propellers buzzing) And don't forget, you would actually need13 more motors than this, so it would be at least six times louder.  So now we've thoroughly establisheda multitude of physical laws have been broken, let's find out exactly how he faked it. And to do that, I've arranged a video call with the undisputed heavyweight championof debunking fake videos using special effects, Captain Disillusion.  - Make sure to get it as flush as possibleagainst your skin to minimize foldsthat might make it hard to chroma key out, like this.  (Mark clears throat)Nice and tight. Mmm.  - Captain!- Oh, hi, Mark. Mark Rober! You weren't supposed to call yet. - It's two o'clock. I'm actually even five minutes late.  - Really?    Well then. (objects whirring)How can I help you?    - Did you not even watch the video I sent?   - Ah, yes, of course. The mobile drone video. I've analyzed it thoroughly, Mark,  and my conclusion is it's totally real. - Seriously?   - Yes, everything except for the mobile drone part, that's fake. If you look very closely, you might just be able to make out the huge, shadowing mask on the side of the phone, visible in every shot of it flying. The creator must have been in a real hurry because it's so messy. Here, it cuts off the edge of the phone. Here, the tip of his finger.  And here, it reveals the thingit's supposed to be hiding, a rod. It's narrow and light colored, and probably attached with the same mounting tape he used to tack on all the other gadgets. That's why he's able to graband adjust the phone in this shot.  By the river, the mask hides not just the stick, but the whole person holding it. Look closer. On this side, the real-time water,  and on this side, a still frame from an empty versionof the shot. And if we track the phone's position and rotation,  we can easily reverse engineerexactly how the stick puppeteer did, rotating mostly from the point where it was held.  - Wow, that was very impressive, Captain D. Thank you for taking the time- - My favorite partof this whole thing is the audio.  The tiny propellers must have madeso little noise at a distance, it didn't give a proper drone vibe.  So the hoaxers recorded the sound of the motors up close, and reused the same clip in every scene, complete with their muttering voices in the background.  (drone whining)(drone whining)(drone whining) - Awesome. Well, thanks again for- - But even more impressive is the number of posts, messages, and tweets presumably from peoplewith functioning eyeballs asking me if this painfully obvious edit is real, over and over. - Okay, Captain, well, take care.  I've gotta go back to my-- Even you, Mark!How could you do this to me?   How could you do- - He's such a joker. (laughs)So it's fake, and now you know exactly all the reasons why, but it's still a really interesting idea.  And I was curious what it would look like if you actuallybuilt one of these using less special effectsand more practical engineering.  So naturally, I called in my buddy, Peter Sripolwhose qualifications include buildinghis own electric plane from scratch, and he immediately got to work.  (bright music)Turns out if you take two brushless motors,  two electronic motor speed controllers, a flight controller that actually has a gyroscopeand an accelerometer integrated,  a 3D-printed frame, and two servos to articulate the rotors, a radio transmitter for a remote control, and a four-cell lipo battery,  and then you put them all together, it actually works. (propeller whining)(machine clattering)Kind of. We had to do a bunch of test flights to calibrate that feedback control loopwe talked about before. So if we notice the drone is either undercompensatedor overcompensating when it starts to fall in a certain way,  we tweak the response sensitivityin between flights until we get to the sweet spot.  And I should mention, remember how the motorsfrom the fake video could barely lift only six quarters?   Well, if you properly size them for the task at hand,  they should be able to lift 150 quarters. And so once we felt like we had it in pretty good shape,  we took her out for the maiden test flight. (gentle music) (camera shutter snaps) (camera shutter snaps)(gentle music)In our defense, it was a little windy out there,  but as you can see, it could be pretty wobbly at times. The truth is, a bi-copter like this totally works.  It just isn't a great design choice. The reason pretty much all camera drones are quad-copteris because they're much more stable due to a larger footprint shared between four motors. And by getting clever with a throttle speeds, you can move in all six degrees of freedom with no moving parts. So there you go, with solid engineering, you don't need hidden rods or masking and rotoscoping, and Sir Isaac Newton can once again comfortably rest in his grave. So the moral of the storyis just don't cheat and lie and scam.  I actually considered going a little easieron Amazing maker, but then I happened to scansome of his other videos, like this knee brace that charges your phone and even powers this flashlight as you walk. In theory, I'll skip the details, but in reality,  this system would also never work as shown, which is why if you rewind that and stabilize on his handin the pocket you see him click a hidden flashlight switch.  Thanks for watching. (bright music) (children yelling) (snowballs striking)  (Mark yelps)More tape!\n","- [Mark Rober] I bet there's cash. - [Player] Oh!- [Mark Rober] Oh dude, we crushed the record. This is an escape room.  It's basically where you and some friendsare placed in a roomand you have to solve a series of puzzles and locksto get out in exactly one hour.  And today I'm gonna give you 10 proven tipsto dominate any type of escape room. And I say proven becauseme and six of my buddies utilize these tips.  And even though about half of ushad never even done an escape room before, we shattered the longstanding record for this roomby finishing in 38 minutes with no clues.  Next, we tried an even harder roomto prove that it wasn't just luck, and there again, we finished in 46 minutes and so the evidence seemed compelling. But for further proof, I had my niece and nephewand a bunch of their friendsfirst try a room without me telling them the tips. They only made it about halfway throughat the end of the full hour. Then we walked through the 10 tips together and then they went back to a new roomwith an equal level of difficulty. And this time they finished in 55 minutes with no clues.  Now you're probably thinkingwhat qualifies me to be giving tipsabout escape roomswhen I've only ever done three myself?   And the answer is absolutely nothing.  They're actually not my tips. I track down the architect and designerof the Red Bull Escape Room World Championships.  He's a college professor. His name is Scott Nicholson. The problem is I live here in Californiaand he's way over here in Brantford, Ontario, in Canada.  And while that's typically a 12 hour tripthrough the magic of YouTube, I knew I could make it therein just a six second travel montage.  (upbeat music plays)  - [Mark Rober] Okay, so I am here now in Canadaat the Begin Lab at Laurier Universitywith Scott Nicholson.  Scott, what the heck do you do?   What is this place?   - Well, this place is where I make games. Our focus here is actually making games to change the world.  So a lot of the games we make herehave some sort of learning outcome. Our goal is to help get people to learn stuffin a playful way. - [Mark Rober] So Professor Nicholson and Ihung out together for a day as he generously spilledout the information in his very large brain. He even put me through a few challengesand puzzles of my own.  And so here are the 10 tips I came awaywith after hanging out with him. The first tip is to think simple. Think generally. Keep reminding yourself that the average person should be able to complete this room in one hour. In a well-designed room, you won't need any extra knowledgebesides what you can just find in the room.  People tend to overanalyzeand just go down a rabbit hole. So for example in one room, we found the travel log of a robber,  and he went from Washington down to Mexico Cityup to Toronto. Now first we were trying to look at the interstates he would travel onand maybe that was a code, and then we're likemaybe we should unscramble the names of the countries.  And then we realized his path forms a Vwhich happened to be the first letterin a combination lock we were trying to open.  If you can't find a simple answer to a puzzle, chances are it's because all the necessary informationhasn't been revealed to you yet.  So move on and then come back to it later. The second tip deals with searching. The first thing you should dowhen you enter a roomis for everyone to split upand to start looking for clues and items.  Professor Nicholson actually put methrough my own searching bootcampto point out the typical placesthat things are hidden.  - [Dr. Nicholson] There you go. Always look under tables, always look under rugs. They write codes on the back of rugs. - [Mark Rober] Other spots might be in hollowed out books or in pockets of clothingor behind a door in the room. A super common first time mistakeis to look in places you shouldn't, for example, you won't find a clue by disassembling a ceiling light or a power outlet. Another common searching mistake is to see cluesin things that aren't.  For example, the bottom of this chair has lettersand numbers from the factory, but they're obviously not part of the room designbecause they don't fit with the theme.  Going back to tip one, the clues and key itemsshould be fairly obvious in a well-designed room. And the more escape rooms you do,  the more you'll get a sensefor what is and isn't a real clue. Tip three, organize your stuff. As you search the room, put all the clues and items in one location.  So if you found three similar cupslike this with numbers on the bottom, group them together. As you do this, the bigger picture begins to emerge and it's easier to tell what you're missing. Don't let people just walk around with an itemrandomly in their hand that others don't know about.  You can ask before you start, but almost all rooms have a policywhere you use one clueor one lock only one time.  So once you've used a clue or item, put it in a discard pileand be sure to leave any key in the lock that it opened.  This helps avoid unnecessary wasting of time. When a team member is working on a puzzlethey don't realize has already been solved and used.  For tip four, now that your team is starting to make sense of the roomlaser focus on what is stopping you from moving forward. You are going to feel overwhelmed at the beginning.  Even with our record breaking times, about halfway through I thoughtthere is no way we're gonna even come close to finishing. But then you solve one thingand then everything else starts falling into place. To help with this, work backwards from the thing that is stopping you,  identify the inputs it needs. For example, in this room, you see there's a lock hereand it looks like the key is right here but you need some kind of hanger to fish it out. Now there's a cabineton the wall that probably contains that hanger and it has a lock that needs three letters and two numbers. So now you can focuson clues that will yield three numbers and two lettersand you won't be as vulnerable to red herrings.  - So red herring is something that's put into the roomthat has no bearing upon the game. It can be something simple, oh, this has gotta be really important.  - Yeah. - Clearly. - Yeah. - Or some roomseven have red herring puzzlesthat lead to nothing.  As a player, it's incredibly frustrating. And so we've done some studies. So most players hate red herringsbecause they're a waste of our time.  About half designers hate red herringsand will not put them in their rooms. And about half are like, yeahthey're okay to have in the room. - By working backwards on the immediate inputs that are needed, you'll avoid wasting time on red herring clues. Tip five is about team roles.  According to Dr. Nicholson, poor communication is the number one reasonwhy teams fail. He has a list of eight different rolesthat team members can be assigned which I will link below, but the one that seemed the most criticalin our experience was project manager. Because it helps alleviate this issue of poor communication.  - The project manager shouldn't get overly involvedin puzzles. Instead, the project manager is the personpeople report to and say, Hey, there's a four digit combination lock over there.  - I see. - And the project manager will call that out. Okay, everyone we're looking for four digits. Someone comes up and says,  Hey, there's, there's a five letter word lock there. Okay, we're looking for five letters. There's a poster over there that looks funny. Okay, so everyone take a look at that poster.  If you're searching for something, you might find it in that poster. So the project manager should keep an ideaof what are the active tasks,  what needs to be done. - Yeah. - Who's working on what, and keep the game flow going. - I see. - But try to keep themselvesout of getting buried in puzzles.  - That makes sense. - So they can keepa scan of what's happening. - So the first five tips focused on general team strategies, but the last half will be about puzzle solving strategies.  You should be familiar with the most common locksand their inputs because again, if you're working back from what's stopping you and you know a lock requires three letters, then everyone could just focus on finding three letters. The standard key lock is the most obvious.  Then a combination lock where you're just lookingfor four numbers in a specific order. Or here where it's a combination lockof letters and numbers, but five total.  Then your classic dial lock where you need threenumbers total, and you start by spinning clockwise. Then open it like this.  Then you've got this directional lockwhich is a little trickier because it can have anywherefrom two to 30 inputs. Squeeze down here threetimes to wipe it clean if you need to try again.  Finally, you have one of these lock boxes that are, againtricky because they've got anywhere from two to 10 inputs,  but it's good to know they can only use each number onceand the order doesn't matter. So one, six, zero, five works,  but so does five, zero, six, one. A critical tip with locks is if you're pretty sureyou have the right code, but it's not opening have someone else try before you move on. Just given the pressure of the game. We had this tip save us on three separate occasions.  And finally, you can skip trying to figureout the last digit if you know all of the rest of them justby trial and error, because there will only be 10 options.  According to Professor Nicholson's research, about half of all escape roomswill have some kind of codethat you need to decipher. - [Dr. Nicholson] There's a few basic codes I've seen again and again, and just knowing what they look like is useful. Now, you're not gonna be expected to memorizethe encoding scheme, but it tells you, ah, we're looking for an encoding scheme.  - [Mark Rober] So the upper left, anytime you see dots and dashesyou should be thinking Morse code. Usually it's written, but sometimes it can be lights that are flashing long and short or even long and short sounds. The upper right is called pigpen cipherand it's often disguised as hieroglyphics.  The key will look something like this. So see if you could decode the message. Then anytime you see dots in a group of six like this,  you know you're looking at a braille key. Each letter in braille is some combination of six dots. And finally, Dr. Nicholson said in his experience,  the only time you might not get a decoder keyis if there are a set of numbers ranging from one to 26.In that case, you match them up with a corresponding letter in the alphabet. So this becomes H E L L O. Tip eight is about written clues.  Dr. Nicholson created this challenge for meof the four most common styles of hiding cluesin written text. Pause the video and see if you can find the four separate hidden messages here. The first is the most obvious with the bold letters. Look at the watch face.  The second are all the words missing a letter. So remove the telephone keypad, find the secret. Next, and this one stumped us for a little while in one of the rooms we did, is to just look at the capitalized words. The secret code is six, seven, three, four.  And finally, if you look at the first wordof each new line on the left side, the secret phrase is goodnight sweet prince.  The key in each of these is looking for somethingthat stands out from the normal pattern you would expect to see. Which leads us to our second to last tip. Look for patterns. Dr. Nicholson gave me one last challenge here. - [Dr. Nicholson] Now the lock that you have might indicate you need to enter thingsin the order of red, green, blue. - [Mark Rober] This one is pretty straightforward, but what do you think the code is here?    In fact, pause the videoif you want to decipher all three codeson the board here. The top is four, three, six, based on the number of sides.  This one at the bottom, you just need to count the different colored circlesand then enter them in that order. So three, six, four, one.  And finally in the middle you see this digitalnumerical notation used a lot in escape rooms. So here the code is five, four, seven.  Apologies to my colorblind peeps out therebecause you probably couldn't solve that last one, which is exactly the type of reasonwhy you should cycle people through trying to solve the tough puzzles. A fresh perspective is all it takesin many cases. This helped us multiple times.  And for the final tip, your guide is your friend. Listen closelywhen they're giving their instructions at the beginning. A lot of times they will give subtle hints about issues that trip a lot of people up. You can also ask them high level questionslike if they have a one lock, one use policy.  And even if you don't want hints, you can ask them to prompt you if you're waybehind where most people would be at a certain point. At the end of the day, you're there to have fun.  So it's better to take a hintand feel the excitement of escaping the room, than being stuck on a frustrating clue for 40 minutes.  And finally, fewer people is almost always better. Statistically, you'll have a higher success ratebecause you don't have to deal with the issues of poor communication amongst 10 people. But there's also a finite numberof fun things to do in a room. So the fewer people you have,  the more fun stuff that everyone gets to do. To quote from Dr. Nicholson's Twitter, my policy for the number of people in an escape roomis the same as the number of people in a tent,  no matter what the package says, you'll have a better time at half capacity. So there you go. Now you know all the best strategies to dominate your next escape room. Thanks for watching. (bell dings)(upbeat music plays)  (snowballs shoot) \n","(rock skipping) - What is the scientifically proven best way to skip a rock?   This is kinda hard to figure out because every rock you throw is a little different, not to mention your throwing motionmight accidentally vary in between throws.  And so, to solve that, I built a perfect rock-skipping robotwith my nieces and nephews. So today I'm gonna show you how we used what we learned from the perfect robotto improve their throws on average from 3 to 13 skips.  Let's get started.  (upbeat music)This is Lake Cavanaugh. It's located here in Washington State.  I came here every summerfor a few weeks as a kid growing up,  and my memory of it is just this magical placeto be outdoors and to be with family,  but to also discover my independence. (upbeat music) And of course, to find a way to compete in anything.  (children laughing)Including rock skipping.  And this was my first time back in 15 years, So to commemorate that, I wanted to build something really cool.  So we took a clay pigeon throwerand tweaked the spring and machined an adapter plate,  and then made some custom throwing arms from wood. Then we created a base for stability. And now all that was left was to challenge my nieces and nephews to a rock skipping contest. Only I might have neglected to tell them about my creation.  Actually, forget this. - I knew it. (crowd laughing) - [Mark] You guys ready?   - [Crowd] Three, two, one.  (Mark yelling)- So it actually wasn't that impressiveright out of the gate, but that was intentional because for this video, I wanted to pull back the curtainon some secrets about the engineering design process.  There are four steps I follow for any big projectI've ever built on this channel or in real life.  The first is research. I will go online and look at any published papers, watch any videos on the topic, and then talk via Skype or email with any experts I can find. That usually gives me a rough idea of where to start. And so the next step is to build a prototype.  A good prototype is cheap and easy to reconfigure, so you can try a lot of different things. And then step three is to do a sensitivity analysis with the prototype. That means we try lots of different combinations of settingsto see what actually matters and what doesn't.  And only at that point are we ready to takewhat we've learned and move to step four,  which is building the final version. (children screaming)So often, people want to jump straight to step four,  which usually won't work, but it's almost worse if it doesbecause you have no confidence that you're close to the optimal design. For the rock-skipping robot, I'd already done steps one and two. So we all sat down and brainstormed about step three and all the things we could tweakto find the right conditions for the perfect skip. Eventually we came up with four different things to test,  but before we did that, I was told the robot needed to look a lot cooler. (upbeat music)      With mission clearly accomplished,  here are the four variables we decided to test. The first was wrist angle of the robot.  This will change the angle of the rockrelative to the water, as you can see here. So should it be perfectly flat or really steep or something in between?   Next was finding the right arm angle. This changes the angle of the path of the rock relative to the water. So is this better, or is this better, or something in between?    The last two variables had to do with the rocks, but since every rock is going to be unique, we needed a way to control this.  So we decided to make our own rocks out of unfired clay. That allowed us to make lots of samples and to see how many more skips you would getif you varied either the diameter or the thickness.  And if you've ever seen a Primitive Technology video, you know clay is just dirt and water. This is great because it meansit has a similar density to a rock.  And if you dry it in the sun, it's hard like a rock. But then it only takes about 30 minutesto totally dissolve away once you put it in the water.  Then we set up a testing plan, and for each throw, we would change only one thing and then count the number of skips. That way if we suddenly saw a huge improvement, we know it would be from the thing that we just changed.  That's where having a robot is way better than using a humanbecause it allows you to independentlychange one thing at a time. And so as you can imagine, we had a lot of skips that looked like this, or this, or this. (man screaming) But then we started to narrow in on some key parameters, and then they started to look more like this.  Yeah!That's what's up! Woo!(upbeat music)     And I'm not exactly sure you countall those little skips at the end, but depending on that,  I would think we got some throws well into the 60s. (upbeat music)   And so, in the end, we discovered there are four steps to achieving the perfect rock skip. The first is that you want the angle of your rockrelative to the water to be about 20 degrees.  This is the optimal angle to allow the rockto sort of crash into the water and then to make a ramp, and then use its forward momentum to ride up that ramp and shoot back up out of the water. And that's the exact physics that explains why rocks skip.  Next, you want the path of your rockrelative to the water's surface to be about 20 degrees.  This means you sort of need to start to throw high, which gives you some potential energyto put into the system,  in the same way a ball bounced from this heightwill bounce more times than a ball bounced from here. Now, before making this video,  I assumed you wanted to throw as lowand parallel to the water as possible, like this, but actually, the ideal throw looks something more like this. Here's the guy who holds the world record in rock skipping, throwing from a bridge to demonstrate you don't need a super low throwto the water to have it skip. The third key is to flick the rock with your wristas much as possible to get it spinning.  As you know, spinning things are more stable. This is because they have angular momentum and resist having it changed, according to Newton's first law. So spinning, and therefore, stability is important because it will maintain that magic 20-degree ramp anglewith the water, as you can see here.  If it's not spinning enough, it will rotate over and then sink. And finally, rock choice is important,  but not in the way I originally thought. Primarily, it just needs to be flaton the bottom to create that ramp. But shape and diameter don't matter nearly as much.  The heavier the betterbecause you put more energy into the system, but not so big that you can't reach the terminal velocity of your arm by the time you release the rock. This is especially important for kids.  They'll see much more success with small, lightweight rocks. And I should also mention that we looped backand checked a couple of papers we discovered about rock skipping. And for the most part, it matched really closely to what we discovered ourselves.  And so armed with our new knowledge, I put all the nieces and nephewsthrough rock skip bootcamp to get the perfect technique into their muscle memories. And while it started a bit rough, they all eventually graduated.  (upbeat music)  And the clay discs tended to be a little more forgiving. So we trained with those first,  and then graduated to actual rocks, and the principles translated perfectly.  And so after our hard workout, like all true performance athletes, we carb loaded.  So there you have it. In addition to learning to skip rocks like a pro, hopefully you picked up some tips on the engineering design process. People ask me all the time, I have an egg drop competition coming up.  Here are the materials I can use. What's the best solution?   I don't know, no one doeswithout running some tests because it depends on the actual rules of the competition, or maybe the brand and materials you chose, or how you actually put it together.  So you should do some Googling for inspiration, and then make a bunch of prototypesand do small changes on each to see what matters and what doesn't. And only then go backand build your final version with some confidencethat you're gonna dominate the competition.  (drone whirring)(upbeat music)    (men laughing)  \n","- This is a mousetrap car. (funky music)They're coming for competitions in high schoolphysics classes, just like the egg drop challenge or building toothpick bridges. The goal is to build a car that travels the furthestor goes the fastest, but in either case, the only power provided to move the car is from a single mouse trap. So today I'm gonna show you how to win first placeby building some cars with the world record holder.  And then we're gonna go to the West Coast championships tosee all these principles in action. And, don't leave. I know that 99. 7% of you have never nor will ever make one of these, but I will break down in simple terms howI know this car will go twice as far as this oneand then I'll prove itand then we'll discuss why you see these DVD wheels so often. But do they work and why do some winning cars havewheels that look like this?   But before we fly all the way out to Texas tomeet the world record holder, I need to lay the foundation for the one overarching fundamental physics principlebehind the mousetrap car. It's called mechanical advantage. And to do that, I'm gonna need my niece and nephews.  I'm gonna bet you guys I could lift my car off the groundusing just my pinkies. If I can't do it, can have this crisp Benjamin,  but if I can you, guys have to grab me ice cream. All right, deal?    - I said nothing else but your pinkies. - I am just using my pinkies. - No, just your pinkies. - That's what I'm doing.  This is really good you guys. Thank you. If you're willing to move a greater distanceyou're able to reduce the amountof force by a proportional amount.  I can't lift 500 pounds worth of car one timebut I could lift 10 pounds 50 times. A mechanical advantage is the ratioof the output force over the input force.  So in this case it's 50.That means my hand had to travel 50 times furtherthan just lifting the car in one shotbut the weight was 50 times less so it was totally worth it. This principle of mechanical advantage is everywhere. Let's take a look at a few examples. If I have four pulleys, that means I have to pull the rope down four times further than the dumbbell goes up. But in exchange, it feels four times lighter. So this has a mechanical advantage of four. For the ramp, you look at the ratio of the length to the height. Your mechanical advantage therefore is 2. 2. That means I have to travel a little furtherbut the brick should feel 2. 2 times lighter pulling up the ramp versus just pulling the brick straight up. And sure enough, if you measure each with a scalethis is exactly what you see. If you think about ita screw is just a ramp wrapped around a nail.  So here you look at this as traveledaround the thread and divide by the space inbetween the threads to get a mechanical advantage of nine. And as you know, if you really wanna multiply your force use a ratchet wrench. Now the distance your hand travelsfor one full rotation is 300 times longer than the distancethe screw moves vertically between one thread.  The total mechanical advantage is 300.It's like a really long short ramp. So if this scale reads six poundsthe actual clamping force would be 300 times more or nearly a ton. And with wheels and axles, it's the same story. Since this wheel diameter is twice what this one isas you could probably guess by now this weight weighs twice as much. So now we're balanced with a mechanical advantage of two. And you'll also notice if I move thisthe lesser weight travels twice as far.  And finally we have leverswhich is where we started with my niece and nephews. Here, if you compare the ratioof the distances from the pivot pointwe have a mechanical advantage of four, which of course means I have to move this end four times further. But it's super easybecause it's one fourth the weight on this side. And in all of these examples, which you see everywhere around us, you trade lower force for more distance travel. This is how humans built amazing thingsbefore all these fancy machines with engines came around,  human muscles are totally strong enough as longas you're willing to spend a little more distanceto do the task.  And so this principle mechanical advantage is at play overand over again with the mousetrap cars only in reverse. It works both ways. In other words, I don't want the full forceof the spring acting over this tiny distance to act directly on the wheels or they would spin out. That would be a very inefficient transferof energy from the spring.  So we use mechanical advantageand make the main lever arm 15 times longerthan the spring lever arm. And then the wheel diameter is 24 times biggerthan the wheel axle.  So then if we multiply themour total mechanical advantage is one over 360.That means the force is 360 times less right hereon the output at the wheels to the floor versus right here on the input on the spring. It also means we'll travel 360 times furtherthan the distance this spring arm rotates.  Alright, so that's enough of a foundation for nowlet's go to Texas and meet upwith my buddy Al to build some race cars. (upbeat music) - [Man] U. S. A. (upbeat music)- [Mark] Not only is he the mousetrap carworld record holderbut he also kind of started the whole thing and he was Texas high school physics teacher of the year. And since my dream job is to one day switchfrom working as an engineer in the private sector togo teach high school physics somewhere,  I made him show me all his cool demos. - I came up with this idea back in 1991 and since that time I have literally built thousands and thousandsof mousetrap cars myself. I've seen every possible engineering designyou could ever come up with.  - And there's lots of different variationsfor rules for a mousetrap car race. Let's talk abouthow to build the best long distance car first. For our testing, we started with three identical cars.  The only difference was the length of the leather arm. So one was short, one was medium, and one was long. And I've calculated each of their mechanical advantages which you can see written here. And given what we know about mechanical advantagewhat do you think is about to happen?   - Ready?    - Yep. As you might've guessed, the short lever arm car takes a strong early lead. This makes sense because it has the largest mechanicaladvantage, therefore the highest force where the wheelsand ground meet. The downside is that it's a short-lived burst and the medium and long lever arm cars pass it once it's quickly usedup all its energy.  In the end, this is how far they each traveled with the longest leverarm car going the slowest, but making it all the wayto 30 feet. This brings up the first principle for the long distance car, to win you want the smallest possible forceover the longest possible distance. In other words, the smallest fractionfor mechanical advantage possible.  You want your car to be barely creeping forward to wasteas little energy as possible. You can think of the total energy of the springas this amount of water in this cup, and then this cup represents the amount of energy that's passedonto your car to move it forward. If you just quickly dump in all the energy,  a ton spills and splashes out, this will be due to lossesfrom extra heat generated or even drag force from the windwhich is proportional to your velocity squared.  But if you do it slowlyand more controlled, much more energygoes to actually moving your car forward.  The next thing we tested was adding graphite to the axleson all three of the cars and then we erase them. This made a huge difference and now they went this far, again the longest lever armcar won because it was the slowest. But this shows the importance of dealing with friction. It's definitely your biggest enemy with these cars and the friction comes from two spots. You have the rolling frictionbetween the wheels and the groundand then the biggie is between your axles and the car body.  This is why we put the lubricating graphite powder there. To take our testing a step furtherwe took the long lever arm carand added ball bearings in place at the graphite and that set a new record for us at 50 feet. So if you only have one hour to make your carand you wanna have a good showingyou can use a long lever arm like this in conjunction with the CD wheels to give you a mechanical advantageof about one over 360and then use ball bearings at the axlesor just apply some graphite and you're gonna do pretty well.  Next, we figured if long lever arms make it travel slowerand therefore further, we should do a super long lever arm.  But it only made it to herewhich was worse than even the short lever arm car. The problem was that it didn't coast very well because we had to make it really bigwhich means it's more heavy, which means more friction. You know this already intuitivelybecause it's harder to push a heavy object on a table than a light objectbecause there's more friction resisting you. So principle three is to make it lightweight. I love this example though because it shows you need to balance these principles. If you take any oneof them too far than another principle will creepin and start penalizing you. It's an optimization problem and that's what makes the mousetrap racers such a great project. That's also why testing is so important. So tweaking and testing different thingslike Al and I did is critical for honing in on the sweet spot for your specific design. Next, we tried this big wheel designwhich is a popular approach. The strategy here is the wheel is 56 times larger than the wheel axle. So when you combine it with the lever armyou get a built-in mechanical advantage of one over 840and that's the equivalent of a lever arm that's two and a half feet long, but without needing the big heavy carthat seems like a good deal and as suchit was our best car yet and made it all the way to here.  The downside isthat it takes energy to get a big wheel like that rotating. It's called rotational inertia. Here's the demo I built to showcase this principle.  These two wheels are identicalexcept this one has the steel weights placedat the outer edge of the wheel versus near the axle. This means it has a higher rotational inertia.  So when we spin them both identicallythe one on the right starts spinning fasterand will reach a higher max speedbut the one on the left will coast for longer. By having bigger heavy wheels, you're basically using them as a temporary storage for your energyand then you give it back during the coasting phase. The problem with this is anytime you transfer energy you lose some. Going back to the cups, a little splashesout each time you pour it, no matter how slowly you do it. So instead of pouring your spring energy into a big cup and then eventually getting it back in the coasting phaseit's better just to have reasonable size wheelsand just have one slow pour directly into the final cup of making your car move. Additionally, big wheels like this can be hard to steer. So principle four is to reduce rotational inertia.  This is also why you see peopledo this to their wheels sometimes. It's an effort to keep the wheels largein diameter to get that built-in mechanical advantagebut to make them wait less to reduce the energy given to rotational inertia. So the final test we ran was Al's world record carwhich traveled an astounding 600 feet. When he set the record, he did some crazy things like using jewelers bearings on the axlesbut the real secret is this pulley here in the middle. If we look at the ratiosand calculate the mechanical advantagefrom the lever, to the pulley, to the wheels we're looking at one over 4, 608.It's the equivalent of a 16 foot lever arm or a back wheel four and a half feet in diameter, but without the downsideof the extra weight or wasted rotational inertia, this thing barely crawls along. It's hard to even see the spring lever arm moving as this back wheel spins. It's really hard to beat a design like this. And now we'll quickly go through the speed car principlesince most of the same principles apply.  The biggest difference is this time we want toaccess all the energy from the springin a short burst right at the beginningbecause the finish line is only 15 feet away.  So it doesn't make sense to have a really smallmechanical advantage like the pulley car. Here we want it much closer to the direct forceof the spring itself, which would be mechanical advantage one.  Problem is if we did that, the wheels would slip. So you basically want to incrementally increaseyour mechanical advantage by making your rear axle thicker and thicker with tape until your rear wheels start to slip. Slipping is bad of coursebecause that's wasted energy because your wheel is spinningwithout actually moving your car forward.  It's helpful to zoom in and use the slow-moon your phone to see if your wheels are slipping or not. This means having good tractionon your rear wheels is importantbecause it means you can have higher forces before you start to slip. These squishy foam wheels work greatand just like with the distance car, reducing frictionby using bearings or graphite will definitely help.  As will making it lightweightbecause Newton's second law teaches usthat heavier things are harder to accelerate. Just like you throw a baseball furtherthan a heavy bowling ball and smaller diameter wheels not only helpby keeping your mechanical advantage closer to onebut you don't have time to give energyto these big wheels and then get it back through coasting.  You want all that spring energy to go directlyinto making your car go forward. Okay, so those are the basic principles. Before we head to the West Coast Mousetrap Car ChampionshipsI'll just mention I put a listof 10 practical quick build tips in the video description. For example, you should soak your bearings in WD 40 to remove all the grease. The grease is usefulif the bearings are actually seeing a lot of loadbut since he's cars weigh next to nothing, it's only gonna slow you down.  I should also mention that my buddy Al hasan amazing website called docfizzix. comwhere you can buy all the parts I showed today to experimentand come up with your own unique design.  I'll also put that link below. Here we go. (upbeat music)- [Man] U. S. A.  (upbeat music)- For this competitionthe objective was to travel forward 15 feet and then return back and stop as closeto the exact same spot you startedin the least amount of time. Those moves may seem complicatedbut you can switch from forward to reverse by simply switching the direction you wrapup your axle halfway through, and you can stopat a certain point by using a wing nut on a threaded axle. So given the rulesyour design choices should foster both speed and precision.  About half the designs relied on preconceived notionsand use CD wheels, which are a real bad choice herebecause you're not looking for distance.  They have more rotational inertia and poor traction. The winning team carwhich I won't show here because the finals are next monthreally focused on precision.  They used ball bearings, small foam wheelsand they made their car body out of aluminum. It weighs more than balls of woodso it did cost more energy to friction, but there's plentyof energy in the spring for only traveling 30 feet.  So it was worth the tradeoff for the extra rigidity and repeatability. They also told me they testedand tweaked their design for six months.  It was awesome to hang outand see all the various design approaches. Hopefully you learned enoughby now to give you a solid foundationfor your own unique design so you can build, test, tweak like crazy and then dominate the competition.  Thanks for watching. (upbeat music)  \n","- I designed this machine to win the jackpotevery time on arcade gameslike these where you have to hit the button at the exact moment the light comes by. So the plan was for me to be a hero amongst my buddies and a veritableChuck E. Cheese Robin Hood, giving out free tickets to all the little kids. But that's not what actually happened.  It actually turned out way more interesting. And the more I tested, the more I realized. This was turning into a repeat of when I used physics to expose the rigged Carnival games. Because by building a super-precise little robot I discovered arcade gameslike this are pretending to be one thing when in fact they're total scams. Now, in order to explain just how bad they're scamming you let me first explain how my machine works and then walkthrough the results of our testing for the past two months.  Fundamentally, the way this works is you havea photo resistor right here and it senses the light five or six lights upstreamof where you need to hit the button to get a jackpot.  And then after a pre-programmed delaythe plunger comes down and hits the button.  To build this, my buddy John and I startedby designing the main base in CAD and then we 3D printed it overnightthen we attached the photo resistor at the endof the articulating arm, and then we took a solenoid with a plunger and attached it to the base.  It's powered by 20 volts worth of AA batteries. And this is the same power pack I usedto trigger the Super Soaker.  And the brainsof the operation is this wireless Arduino board and it connects via wifi to a super-ghetto app that we made. And the app is critical because it lets you adjust the delay between sensing the light and pushing the plunger. So if you miss short you just add a few milliseconds to the delay and try again. And then to disguise the whole thing,  we put it in a backpack and cut a hole in the bottomso the plunger could access the big button on the machine.  So to set it up, you simply walk in, set the backpack down and then pull out your phonelike you're checking dank memes. As you can see, the disguise worked really well and no one ever suspected anything. So at this point we were ready for our first real world testand the results were disappointing.  We were getting jackpots, but only about every 30 tries. And what was so frustrating is we got the timing dialed in so well, we would miss shortby one light and then not adjust the timing at all.  And then on the very next runwe would miss long by one light.  So for 30 attempts without changing anything about halfwere missing one light short, and the other half were missing one light long. So this could mean only one of two things.  Either we had some errors in our machine that wasintroducing some variability or there was something shady going on with the game itself.  And troubleshooting because things don't go as plannedis incredibly common when doing any engineering task.  So to fix it, you have to systematicallydo some detective work to figure out where the error is coming from. In the last interview Carl Sagan ever gave, he said-- - Science is more than a body of knowledge. It's a way of thinking.  - So here was our thought process. I knew if I could prove that my machine was super precise then the only reason we weren't getting a jackpot would bebecause the game was rigged.  So I need to start by lookingat any potential sources of variability error in my machine.  There were only three, so it could be the photo resistorthe solenoid, or the Arduino.  There was one external source we consideredand that was light pollution from all the flashing lights in the arcade could mean the inputto the light sensor was too noisy and therefore not repeatable. Now, there's a trick when it comesto troubleshooting where you test several potential error sources at the same time. And if I can get really precise results within this loop then I know that noneof those components are the source of the errorwithout having to take time to test each individually.  So to test all three of these at oncewe made a simple app that flashed a white screen and started a stopwatch at the exact same time. And then we set the trigger for exactly one second later.  And sure enoughwe were getting results with one millisecond precision.  We also repeated the test with an incandescent bulb justlike the game, and got the same super accurate results.  Now to appreciate that one millisecond of precision one flap of a hummingbird wing takes 12 milliseconds.  So one millisecond is literally this long.  If you pull out your phoneand try and get the stopwatch to landon 4.00 seconds, that's really hard.  And this is just to two decimal places. I had some friends of mine use a timer app that went out to three decimal places, which is milliseconds.  And then I challenged them to land exactly on four seconds. And in 100 tries,  these mere humans with their pitiful non-machinereaction times were only able to do it once whereas my robot can do it pretty much every time.  So there's definitely no error comingfrom the hardware componentsbut maybe the sensor is being told to trip at different timesbecause there's so many additional flashing lightsin an arcade.  And to investigate that, we looked at the signal datafrom the sensor, which looked really noisy and low like this until you see a spikein intensity every time the light would come around which is when the delay countdown would start. Because we had such a narrow field of viewon the sensor when we compared the time between each of the peaks, it was also precise down to the millisecond.  So light pollution wasn't the issue either.  With this in mind, I headedto a different arcade with some family friendsand their kids to see if things would be any different.  And we did win a few jackpots.  (kids cheering) - Yes!- But for the most part, once againwe would alternate missing by one light on either side of the jackpot without making any adjustments to my machine which as a reminder can repeatedly hit the same mark within one 12th of a hummingbird wing flap. And so at this point, it was pretty clear that these games just randomly hand out rare jackpots. But just to be sure, I did some digging and was able to locate a 25-year-old manual for the cyclone arcade game. And sure enough, if you flipped all the wayto the back to page 31, it states, the machine owner can specify how often they want a jackpot to be won  which actually makes sense because in our testing, a lotof times we'd hit a jackpot right away and then go through a dry spell until we would finallyhit a jackpot again, on average, maybe 30 games later.  And so in conclusion, my issue here isn't thatthis arcade game makes money for the arcade owner.  My issue is this arcade game presents itself as a winnable game of skill when in reality it'sa random dice roll that is heavily stacked against you.  And if you recall from the carnival scam video the most lucrative games for the carnival ownerare those where people overestimate their chances of winning. That is exactly what happens in this game, especially whenyou might play a few games and get it to stop one light short or one light long thinking you are so close to getting a jackpot when in reality you weren't closeat all. In gambling psychology, this is known as the near miss effect, and people will spend muchmore money to try and win because they think they can just do it on the next one. And for that reason, it should come as no surprise that this scam machine is considered the highest earningredemption arcade game ever made.  So if I were you, I'd save your tokens for skee ball.  There's a plunger in the backpackand then it pushes down on the thing.  Is that cool?   - So you're basically cheating on--- Well, I mean cheating's a strong word.  - You're cheating!- I'm using an advantage I might have created myself.  Thanks for watching.  (bright electronic music)    \n","- I'm sitting in a hot tub filled to the brimwith solid sand.  (laughs)This is one of the coolest things ever.  If you take a tub of sand like this, and then add air in just the right way, it basically becomes a liquefied soup.  (chill music)     In science, this is known as a fluidized bed.  It's used in industrial applicationssuch as powder coat painting or in grain silosto make sure that the grain flows smoothly to the outlet.  (chill music)  With air on, the top surface is nearly frictionless. It's like an air hockey table.  And then when you cut off the air,  it freezes everything exactly where it's at. (chill music)   So today I'm gonna show you how to make a simple version like this yourself. And then because I became curious what it would feel liketo be fully immersed in something like this,  we made a hot tub sized version. As you can see from this 60 year old videofrom the Royal Institute of Science,  this demo isn't exactly new. I've wanted to build one for a long time, but you can find literally no information online on how to make one like that. So I started combing through a bunch of patent drawingsfor massive industrial sized fluid beds,  and I noticed that instead of one big inlet, they all had a bunch of small holes to deliver the air.  So starting with that in mind, it still took us 25 failed versions before we arrived at this design. As you can see, it's just a bunch of half inch PVC pipesarranged sort of in a ladder.  But the key is to drill two one millimeter holes90 degrees apart from each other,  and then do a bunch of thosespaced 25 millimeters apart. Then you glue all the pipes together,  and just make sure you orient the holes down. So that will keep the sand from getting in. And then you just seal off the container with some hot glue.  And then fill your container with either fine sand, or we found glass beads worked really well. And you could power with a small air compressor like this,  or you could just rent a large nitrogen containerlike this for about 30 bucks,  and that'll give you 10 minutes of runtime. As usual, I'll put a link to all of the partsI use the build in the video description.  So my buddy Ken, had an old broken spa in his backyardwhich we decided to put to good use. (driving music)   (laughs) It just stops and you're like, locked in place.  It's like a weighted blanket on every surface of your body.  Oh!(chill music)     Now that it was tested and ready, in my ongoing quest to be the favorite uncle, (kids yelling) I decided to surprise my nephews with it.  (screaming)  But before we get to swimming in sand,  let's talk about the science behind a fluidized bed. Wait, wait, wait, don't click awayif you think science is boring,  if you're new here, you should know that my approachto science is similar to velociraptor hunting patterns. I try to bring people in with a catchy thumbnail or a cool thing to see, and then when they least expect it.  (velociraptor growls)- Clever girl. (velociraptor roars) - Admittedly, the analogy breaks down a little at the end. But if you promise to hang with me for the next two minutes, I promise to try and walk the delicate line between trying to make things simple to understand, without oversimplifying or being condescending. fluidization is just when you have enough upward air so that the force of the air pushing on each grain of sandis equal to the downward force of gravity or weight.  And when that happens on any individual grain of sand,  it hovers in equilibrium like this. You can think of forces acting on an objectlike a tug of war. And if an object is an equilibrium,  that means there's a tie, and it doesn't accelerate in either directionjust like in a real tug of war,  if the sides are even. However, if you add stone cold Steve Austin to this side, that will make it totally unbalanced,  and will start to move this way, which is actually what happensif you accidentally turn the air up too high.  As the fluidization occurs in that sweet spotwhere the sand particles hover in equilibrium which makes them easy to move around. This is also the reason sometimes you'll see pools pumpedwith air to cushion the landing for the divers.  Then you notice that some stuff floats in the sandand other stuff sinks. This has to do with the buoyancy force,  which is a function of the density of the surrounding fluidand the volume of the object itself.  Whenever an object exists in a pressure gradient, there are forces from pressure pushing in on all sides,  but they push a little bit harder the deeper than you are, which is why it hurts more to be the bottom guyin a dog pile,  or it hurts your ears more the deeper you dive in the pool. And this makes sense because the deeper you dive,  the more water there is above you pushing down. And if you add up the size and directionof all those arrows, a bunch of stuff cancels out,  and you're left with one net force pointing upwards. That is the buoyancy force.  And if your buoyancy force happens to be greaterthan your force from gravity, you float. And if your buoyancy force happens to be less than the force from gravity, you sink. Now we usually think of buoyancy with water, but you could think of things like helium balloons being buoyant in our atmosphere. So here's a trick question. Which of these has a higher buoyancy force?    It's actually the rubber ball. Buoyancy force has nothing to do with the density of the object, just the volume. So since the rubber ball takes up more space,  it has a higher buoyancy force. But you might object, \"Then why does the rubber ball sink and the balloon floats?   \"Remember, it's a tug of war. The rubber ball sinks because the force from gravity on the thick rubber skin and the air insideis bigger than the buoyancy force. But for the balloon, even though it doesn't have as big of a buoyancy force compared to the ball, it still floats up because that buoyancy force is bigger than the weight arrowfrom the helium and the thin rubber shell. And the helium will keep rising like a ball floating up from deep in a lake, and then it'll eventually hang outwhere the density of the atmosphere is roughly equal to the density of the helium in the balloonbecause that's where the tug of war becomes equal. We made it through.  Now back to my nephews. (funky music)(nephews laughing)   (all laughing)        Okay, cut it.  (all laughing) (sand rushing in slow motion)  (upbeat techno music)    \n","(water splashing)- Now that summer's winding downand you've already spent lots of time in the water,  I wanna show you now how to figure out how much peeis in any pool. There's actually a lot of misinformation on the topic of pee and pools. So I'm gonna do some experiments on my own, along with some clever science people in foreign lands.  And spoiler alert, some of the results are good newsand some aren't. So let's jump right in.  (water splashes)So this first experiment is to determine how much pee isin an actual sample of pool water using an ingenious method.  So I've got two samples from my friend's community pool, where lots of people swim.  One from the pool and one from the spa. And then two samples from a friend's backyard, again, one from the pool and one from the spa.  I also collected samplesfrom the source water at each location as a control. And I'll explain why in a minute.  Now that I have my samples, I needed to quickly getto my scientist friend, Lindsay, in Canada. But lucky for me, I knew a shortcut.  (upbeat music) We are now in the lab of the University of Alberta and this is Lindsay Blackstock and she's basically a genius.  So you are gonna help me determine how much pee isin these samples, 'cause we know people pee in the pool.  - Yes, we have strong evidence that people do peein the pool. So we're gonna try to find a way that we can measure that pee without actually measuring pee. I'm gonna apply my new strategy, based on the amount of artificial sweetener that's in the pool. We know artificial sweeteners don't comefrom anywhere except for urine.  So that's the only logical source for them. If we find them in the pooland we know how much artificial sweetener is in the average person's pee. - Right. - And then using that we can estimate how much pee'sin the pool.  - Got it. So we're gonna take this sample, we're gonna bring itover to our sample prep bench. - Okay. - We're gonna filter it,  transfer it into some special vials, into this instrumentwhich is a liquid chromatography system.  - Of course. - So this instrument that's going to concentrate our sample before it passes it on over to the second instrument, which is a mass spectrometer. And the mass spectrometer is able to detect the individual little artificial sweetener moleculesone by one.  - Love it. Let's get to work. - Bring it on over there. (Lindsay laughs) - Before we run the samples, let me explainwhy I find Lindsay the scientist's solutions so brilliant. You can actually take a sample of pool water and directly measure the amount of urea in there. But the problem with that is humans also excrete ureathrough things like sweat,  which is also very common in a pool. So you can't tell how muchof that urea actually came from pee. To get around that, she looked at the amount of a certain artificial sweetener in the sample, called acesulfame potassium,  which is really common in food products such as these. Oh, and also all of these. So pretty much everything.  The reason drinks like these are zero caloriesis because you taste the acesulfame potassium sweetenerbut the chemical compounds aren't broken down at all by your body. So more than 99% is passed throughin your pee within 24 hours.  And therefore, the only reason this would be in the poolis if it passed through a person first. And just to be sure we measure the source water at both locations, because sometimes trace amountsof the sweetener can be found in the water supply. And if so, we just subtract that from the results.  And I love thisbecause we've all wondered how much peeis in a specific pool, but Lindsay figured out a really clever way to use proven science to actually answer the question.  (upbeat music) (upbeat music continues)  (upbeat music continues)The mass spectrometer takes about an hour to get results.  So while we were waiting, Lindsay told me somethingthat really surprised me.  Chlorine in pools is obviously really helpfulbecause it breaks down harmful bacteria, viruses and microbes that would be harmful or even potentially deadly to humans. However, there is one big downside and that is, it reacts with urineto create a byproduct called trichloramine. - So trichloramine is what's responsible for that chlorine smell. - I see. - That you might get when you enter into an indoor swimming facility. It's also- - But if I just smell chlorinelike straight outta the bottle it kinda has that chlorine smell to it. - Yeah, but the smell that you smellin a pool is trichloramine. Like this is the compound responsible for that characteristic- - I see. swimming pool smell. - If I look skeptical here, it's only because I was.  So I devise an experiment of my own, to see if this was really true. For the experiment, I got two five gallon buckets and filled them with pure water. Then I added four times the recommended concentrationof chlorine, for that volume of water, to both buckets.  And then only in the bucket labeled B, I added just a little bit of pee and then I let it sit for a couple days. Alright, so it's been three days, so this is the moment of truth.  So the first thing I noticed is visually they look the same, you can't tell one bucket from the other,  as far as color of water goes. So I'm gonna start and smell this one first.  Hmm. So that doesn't smell like anything. That smells just like water, even though this has four timesthe recommended concentration of chlorine for this volume,  which makes me nervous to smell this one.  What?   That is crazy!This smells like a pool,  even though the only difference between these twois this has a little bit of pee in it.  This is a nostalgic smell. This smells like summers and vacationingat hotels with pools and water parks.  Turns out it was just pee. So we have trichloramine, which again, is what is produced when pee reacts with chlorine,  was just that classic pool smell. That's not that big of a deal. But the problem is, it's kind of bad news for both your lungs and your eyes. When your eyes are really red after swimming for awhile, that's actually because of the trichloramine from the pee,  not the chlorine. Trichloramine also causes things like asthma.  In fact, studies show asthma's more likely to occuramong elite swimmers than any other high level athlete. Which now makes sense because Michael Phelps admitted to always peeing in the pooland he says all his buddies do too.  So be cool and don't pee in the pool. Now let's go see Lindsay's results. In Lindsay's research, she sampled 20 public swimming pools and 10 public hot tubs. The average concentration of sweetener for the poolswas 470 nanograms per liter.  And for the hot tubs was 2, 247. So after running all of my samples,  we found that here in my friend's backyard pool, they had a concentration of artificial sweetenerof 69 nanograms per liter,  which equates to just under a gallon of pee. Which is actually much lower than the average,  but that makes sensebecause this would see much less use than a public pool. Their spa had a higher concentration than the pool, at 103,  but since the spa contains much less volumethat equates to about this much pee. So far, not bad.  And then in this public community pool, we had 27 nanograms per literof artificial sweetener concentration, which for this volume is again a little bit less than a gallon. And the spa was higher at a concentration of 335, which is about this much for the volume of the spa.  So the concentration of artificial sweetenerin this pool and spa is much, much lower than the averages Lindsay sawin the 30 samples she collected. Which leads me to believethat the water has been completely replaced recently,  which happens from time to time for various reasons. If this pool had the average concentrations reported by Lindsay, for these volumes we would expect to seeover a gallon of pee in the hot tuband about 13 gallons in the pool.  If you want an estimate of the pee in your own pool, I came up with a simple equation after talking with Professor Ernest Blatchley of Purdue University, who mentioned that studies have foundthat swimmers introduce between 25 and 80 milliliters of urine, per swim session. So you take the average number of swimmersthat were in your pool, per day, during the summer and then you multiply that by 1.2. That's how many gallons of pee are in your pool,  at the end of the summer. And if you think your friends and neighborspee more than average, use two as the multiplier.  And if you think they are moreon the courteous side of the range, use one half as the multiplier. As a general rule of thumb though,  public pools about this sizewill contain approximately 13 gallons of pee, and Olympic pools will contain,  brace yourself, over 130 gallons!There are some caveats to these generalizations,  so check out the links in the video descriptionfor published papers from both scientist Lindsayand Professor Blatchley.  So in conclusion, what does this all mean?   Like is this something to be grossed out about?   For starters, let me just say pee is generally considered to be sterile, meaning it's free from bacteriain any living things. You could totally drink the stuff and not get sick.  In fact, in some cultures, that's totally a thing. - You drink the grandson's pee and it's gonna help you.  - Additionally, urine is made of 95% waterand just 5% of dissolved solids,  like the urea stuff we've been talking about. The fact that pee is so dilute at 95% pure water,  is in part, disappointingly why it's really hardto make a chemical you could add to any poolthat will magically turn blue if someone pees in it.  Having said that, I suppose it's still a little grossknowing you're swimming in even just a small amount of pee.  But I feel the benefits to your happiness and well-beingthat can come from swimming, far outweigh any sort of gross factor or minor health risks.  I guess at the end of the day, my advice would be to be cool and don't pee in the pool. And then at that point. ♪ Just keep swimming ♪ ♪ Just keep swimming ♪♪ Just keep swimming, swimming, swimming ♪Just maybe take a shower when you're done.

When the Super Soaker was first inventedit was an absolute game changer in my neighborhood. So now that I'm a dad and I know how to engineer I decided to once againlevel up my water fighting capabilities with this.  The Guinness World Record holding largest water gun ever at seven feet longas a follow up, of course, to my world record largest Nerf gun.  But she doesn't just look good. So I'm gonna show you how we made ithow she stacks up against the original Super Soaker and then we'll talk about the science behind how it works.  But first, let's just take a moment to appreciatethe destructive power of a stream of water traveling at 272 miles per hour.  (upbeat music playing)    (liquid splatters) (chimes playing) (upbeat music playing) - [Mark] Watermelons are great, but I wanted to seehow she would fare in a real water fight in addition to running some further tests. But before we get to those, let's talk about how we made it and how it works.  Together with my buddy Bob and his glorious beard we created a skeleton for the gun. In fact, I won't show it here but if you want all the gory detailson how to construct a large scale replica like thishe uploaded a full video on his awesome YouTube channel called I Like to Make Stuff. I'll put a link in the video description.  And in the endafter some EVA foam and a paint job, we ended up here. So let's take a look under the hood to see the design I arrived at with my buddy, Ken. The first thing you should notice is that most of the mass is down here in the handle, not up here. That's because having a low center of mass is really helpful for stability and maneuverabilityfor something really large like this.  All the components you see here are just a fancier versionof all the components that make up this gun.  It operates on the exact same principles. So let's start by talking about how this one works.  And to do that I figure we might as well askthe actual original inventor of the Super Soaker,  one of my personal engineering heroes, Lonnie Johnson. Of course, one of my first questions to him was how he even came up with this idea. - You see, I got the idea in 1982I was at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory working on the Galileo Project at the time. In fact, I was doing experiments on my own in the bathroom in the evenings.  I wanted to develop a heat pump that would usewater as a working fluid [Indistinct]. I had made these nozzles, I had hooked up to a sink and as I shot the stream of water across the bathroom and I saw how powerful it was and how satisfying it was,  I thought to myself a high pressure, high performance water gun would really be cool. - As I talk more with Lonnie, he showed me the very first prototype he ever built of the gun. We talked about some of the clever design elements.  For example, this tank here that holds the waterdoubles as the pressure container. So each time you pump, you are forcing more and more air into this spot, which makes it more and more crowded with air molecules,  which increases the pressure. And when you pull the triggerthere is pushing down on the water so hard,  the only place it can gois through this tube and out the gun.  And so this is why this tubeis intentionally bent down like thisbecause no matter which way you tilt the gun it's always gonna be below the water lineand therefore water will come out and not air.  And so now in our case, instead of pumpingwe fill this tank up with high pressure nitrogen gas.  And then this tank is filledwith about two gallons of water. And just like the Super Soaker, it has a tube that runs all the way down and is open at the bottom. So then this gas is at a really high pressure and it wants to get out. So when you pull the trigger and open the flowit pushes down on the top of the water which forces it up this tube and out at 272 miles per hour.  And the trigger is just this ball valve joint here. But I thought it would be lameif every time you wanted a fire you had to turn some handle. So we have pneumatic piston herethat's also powered by the nitrogen.  And then we have a solenoid that's connectedto some double A batteries back there for power.  And so when you push this button, it opens the ball valveand allows water to flow through until I release the button. I'll put a link to the CAD files we madealong with a build list of all of the components we used in the video descriptionif you wanna make something similar. Oh, one final cool feature is we have this cover here that's held on with rare-earth magnets. So after you've shot a bunch and need to refill the water and the gas, you can just easily access the fill valvesthrough this window here.  And now back to the gratuitous violence. (upbeat music playing)  (eerie music playing)    - [Mark] Oh, wow. It's a double rainbow all the way.  There's some context on the power of this gun. The original Super Soaker was pressurized to 40 PSI and the pressure from the hose at your houseis just a little more than around 50 PSI.  A fire truck hose comes in at around six times that at 300 PSI. And this beast is eight times the pressure of a firetruck at 2, 400 PSI, which in hindsight is probably overkill.  One final really cool feature of the gun is you can swap out the nozzledepending on what you're shooting. So this nozzle has a really small diameter opening which leads to a high stream velocitybut lower overall water output.  So it's good for cutting or puncturing stuff. Then this nozzle is basically wide open at a quarter inch so it's a little lower velocitybut it's the maximum water output. So it's good for getting things drenched fast or breaking things with force. (glass breaks) (eerie music)  So now with the gun fully testedI wanted to see how it would do in an actual water fight.  So we got together for a party with some family friends, but to make things fair, we took turns picking guns.  But of course I got first pick.  (upbeat music) (group yelling) (water splattering)  (group screaming)(child crying)  (group yelling)(water spraying)  - [Mark] So it worked awesomeand I completely destroyed them until I ran out of water. (group yelling) Thanks for watching.  (upbeat music playing)  (static sounds)  \n","- Ope, here we go. (two rapid horn beeps) - Yes. - That is what I call the courtesy honk.  I just pushed this custom button(two rapid horn beeps) and it's two super quick chirps of the horn that are not only friendly sounding, but it's intentionally not as loud as a normal horn.  So I'm gonna show you how and why I did this and in the process I'll explain what this red button does.   (bell dings)But first, I'm gonna pull over. (machinery grinding) 1.3 million people die in car crashes per year.  So you really wanna be able tocommunicate with other drivers if you wanna stay safe.  When you think about it, cars only havetwo built in ways to communicate with each other.  You got your turn signal, (turn signal clicking) and your horn, (horn honks)and the turn signal is fine.  But the problem with the horn is thatit's so one dimensional.  It's like if your only tool is a hammerit's really good at one thing,  but it sucks at everything else.  (hammer knocking wood)And I don't know about you, but now that pretty much everybody owns a smartphone,  99% of the time I use my horn I'm not trying to avoid a crash, I'm trying to let the person in front of me know it's time to stop reading that text they just received.  And that's the issue, I'm not upset. I just want to be like, hey dude, the light's green.  No big deal.  And this might come as a surprise because I drive a Jetta(cool music) but I'm not some hardcore, angry, road rage, tough guy.  But even this Jetta, which has just aboutthe most emasculating horn possible (horn honks)sounds angry when you honk it at a light.  (horn honks) And if you try and do a nice quick honkit doesn't usually register because it bottoms out too quick. (steering wheel pad thunks) So I just push my custom made courtesy honk button. (two rapid horn beeps) And because it's so non-confrontational this will never happen to me. And this works for communicating in a lot of situations, not just at stoplights.  Like if someone is just sort of drifting in your laneyou're not sure if they see you or not (two rapid horn beeps)but you don't want to use your big horn.  Or, if you just want to get someone's attentionto tell them something.  If someone needs to move forward in trafficor in a drive-thru, it's nice (two rapid horn honks)because you don't wanna seem like a jerkas they can look right at you in their rear view mirror.  You can even use it as a way to say thank you.  (two rapid horn beeps)And I kind of feel like this should be a standard feature on all cars. So you still have your big horn that you can't miss in the case of an emergency.  But there should be a smaller button right over here for the courtesy honk. But the good news is that as an engineer if something isn't exactly how you want it you can just make it exactly how you want it. (gears grinding)So I went on Amazon and got one of these Adafruit Soundboards for 27 bucks where you can upload sound effectsvia USB with no programming required.  And then I got three of these cool horn buttons to trigger the sound effects for seven bucks each.  So I start on this side by wiring thisto my cigarette lighter for power and then I use a 12 to five volt power inverter to get me to the right voltage for the soundboard which is connected to these buttonsto trigger the horn sound effects I dragged and dropped onto there. And then coming outta the board we have a 3. 5 millimeter audio cablethat plugs into a 13 dollar amp to make it loud enough  which connects to a 13 dollar PA speaker.  Now that we have all the componentsmy buddy Bob from the YouTube channel I Like To Make Stuff came overand we got to work soldering.  Well, actually, I did all the workwhile Bob just stroked that magnificent beard of his.  He also made a video about making a custom horn like this that goes into way more detail.  So definitely check his outif you're actually planning on doing this.  This is intentionally more of a temporary setupbut I wanted mine to be a bit more permanent in the dash.  So the help of my talented buddy Howard we went to town installing this thing.  (upbeat music)   (upbeat music continues)   Now the buttons were in placewe connected them through the dash to the PA speaker we mounted to the frame under the hood.  We also installed this beast, which is the same type of horn system used on trains and semi-truck. Basically, there's a compressor that fills an air tank to 120 PSI, which powers the horn, but more on this later.   (train horn blowing) Oh, and the buttons also light upwhich makes them look really cool at night.  I also added one more sound effect that's powered by this button. (digital beeping)This is designed to be even one notch nicer than the courtesy honk if you want to be super chill and grab the attention of a pedestrianwho isn't even in a car.  So that's my pitch, to make our roads more pleasant by increasing the vocabulary of the standard car horn.  And now you can do it yourself. Which leads me to this final button which is only to be used in extreme situations like when two teenagers are taking their sweet time to cross the street in front of you while fidget spinning.  (low fog horn blowing)(Mark laughing) (low boom crashing)Thanks for watching.

And as fair warning, this video is a slight departure from my usual scienc-y/build stuff.  But I've wanted to make it for a really long time so I hope you guys enjoy it.

(exciting music)\n","- I suck at darts, but I'm good at engineering, which means, (board dragging) I'm actually really good at darts.  (upbeat music)    (gleefully chuckling) Most of the projects and builds from my YouTube channeltake a month or two to pull off.  But I've been working on this beastwith my former NASA coworker, John,  for over three freaking years, and here she finally is.  So it's fairly self-explanatory, but you throw a dart,  and as long as your initial throw is somewhere within this diameter or so, the dartboard helps out a little bit.  (board dragging)  (bell ringing)And what's cool is if you use this dart,  it will make you the world's best dart playerbecause you get a bullseye nearly every time,  and even if you don't, it's really close.  But if you use this dart, it makes you the world's worst dart player,  'cause it calculates the initial trajectoryand then moves the board in the exact opposite direction.  (board dragging) (pool balls clanking, background chatter)So eventually we took this thing to a barto see if it would work in the wild.  But before we get to that, let's talk about how it actually works.  (group cheering)Fundamentally, there are two main parts to this system.  First, you need to somehow predict where a dartis going to land with a typical throw from regulation distance. And you have about 200 milliseconds to do that.  And then second, you need to somehow move the board to that predicted location.  And you have about another 200 milliseconds to do that. So let's start with the first part about how we predict where the dart's going to land. So the real secret here is that our dart has these tiny retro reflectors on it and then we have a Vicon motion capture system. As humans, we can see in 3D because we have two eyes and our brain calculates the difference between the two images and then tells us how far or close things are. This is why if you close one eye,  you instantly lose that depth perception. So that's basically what we're doing here,  except we have six eyes all around the room. And each of these eyes or cameras can take a 4K resolution picture 260 times per second.  But since it's hard to visually separate something so small moving so fast in front of a busy background,  they actually use IR so they blast out IR from all these IR LEDs and then it hits the retro reflectors and then bounces back to the lens. So when I wave the dart around like this,  this is what you and I see, but the motion capture system just sees a solitary dart floating around.  One of the reasons this board took us so long to buildwas that for the first two years,  we were trying to make our own motion capture system. So we had our own cameras and one of these awesome NVIDIA TX1 boards which is basically like a raspberry pie on Russian steroids.  But it turns out, it's a super complex problem to solve and the Vicon system was just turnkey. So now that we have the XYZ position of the dart as it travels through the air, we use some MATLAB code to then predict where it will land.  And the trick here is that anything you throw into the air, neglecting air resistance,  will travel in a perfect parabola. Even something you wouldn't think of,  like a high jumper, if you track their center of mass, it actually follows a perfect parabola shape.  So we used our understanding of parabolas and from a side view, we used that to predictthe final up and down position of the board.  And then to predict the finalleft right position of the board, we know from a bottom view a dart will follow a linear path.  So we use good old Y equals MX plus B,  and the Y intercept, or B in this case, tells you how far to move it left and right for the final position.  (upbeat music)   (dart clicks, laughing) Nice throw. So now that we know exactly where to move,  let's talk about how we actually do it.  So the board itself is on two linear sliders,  which allows it to translate to any specific location.  So that provides the track on where to move, but the engine would be these six separate motors you can see from the front. Each motor has a spool and then some fishing line,  and they all attach to the center of the back of the board right here.  Once we have the predicted bullseye spot, the computer does the trigonometry and then sends the commands over here to the motors. So to move to the left, it would say like,  \"You need to spin up but you need to unspinat the same rate. \" Now on the back you can see the computer signalcomes into this Arduino compatible board here,  and then you got some pre-amps herethat bump up the voltage signal to the six individual stepper motor controllers.  And these stepper motor drivers take the moving instructionsand combine it with the power from the plug in the wall,  after it goes through this ACDC power converter.  And then finally, a bunch of voltage pulsesfrom the motor controller cause the motor to take small steps and either wind up or wind down. Now keep in mind all of this happens in less than half a second, and allows us to hit our sub-millimeter precision in our board positioning. Oh, and we don't just make one guess on the final position of the board.  We update and refine that guess anywhere from ten to a hundred times, which is why sometimes you sort of see the board jitter into the final position.  (board dragging)(upbeat music, pool balls clanking) So we took it to a bar to see what people thought.  (group cheering)  (group yelling) (group cheering) In general, we found if you're really drunk,  you get so pumped at your new abilities,  if not slightly confused. - I used to suck at darts.  (group laughing)\n","- We look at the back. Those are the egg sacs. - Dude!- [Manu] I was not kidding. - [Mark] Oh my gosh.  - [Manu] So this might be. . - I'm holding in my hand a microscopethat is waterproof, stomp-proof.  I put it together in two minutesand it costs 50 cents to make. And in this hand,  I have a blood centrifuge that spins 10 times fasterthan a $10000 centrifuge, and it costs 18 cents.  Both of these were invented here at Stanford, in the lab of a brilliant physicist/biologist inventor named Manu Prakash,  with the goal to help improve the lifeof the world's poorest, through low-cost, effective,  scalable inventions. Incredibly, it's believed, of the estimated 100 billion people who have lived on this planet, more than half have died of malaria.  The symptoms are similar to the flu, and so this gold standard for diagnosisis to take a drop of blood, spin it in a centrifuge,  and then look at it under a microscope. Historically, this has been really hard to do in the places that need it most, because the equipment can cost tens of thousands of dollarsand it needs electricity.  These two inventions can diagnose malaria, cost less than a dollar, and require no electricity.  - Manu, good to finally meet you. - Absolutely.  - You're like a superhero. - Oh, I don't know about that. - From an engineering perspective, what you do is amazing.  Now before I continue with Manu, let me just support that statement by showing youhow this 50-cent paper microscope actually works.  So it comes like this, and then you pop out the pieces of paper,  and then follow the simple instructionslike folding origami. The lens is actually a tiny sphere of glass embedded in this plastic. (gentle music) And you can put your slide in here, and then you look through that tiny glass sphere and it's magnified 140 times. You can even put your phone up to it and film and then capture video like this. (gentle music)  (gentle music continues)  (gentle music continues)  Your lab at Stanford, what do you do?    What's your mission?   Just like the high level.  - I grew up in India. And one of the things that I've always enjoyedis getting exposed to scientific tools.  When I started the lab, it was very clear that we have this hunger for scientific tools that's missing. And so we spend almost 50% of our time building and designing scientific tools under the umbrella of 'frugal science'. It can't cost a ton of moneybecause every zero that you add to a scientific event,  probably hundreds and thousands and millions and billions of people cut off. - We wanted to test drive this paper microscope.  So we got a scoop of seemingly clear water from this pond.  And there was one tiny white speck that didn't settleto the bottom of our bag. So Manu suggested we take a closer look.  - They can sense suction. - Oh, okay. - And they run away. - Oh, really?    - It's kind of like a fly when you're trying to swat it. It senses your hand coming before it comes.  And that's what's actually happening. It realizes, just like it's about to go into a mouth of a fish,  it runs away. But I think I'm gonna get it. It's. .  - You got it. - There it is. Okay.  - [Mark] Oh, there he is. He's in this one. - [Manu] Oh, perfect. - [Mark] And remember, to the naked eye, you can barely see this tiny white speck.  Whoa!- That's the single eye. You see that?    - [Mark] Yeah!- [Manu] That little spot right there?   And then we look at the back. Those are the egg sacs.  - [Mark] Dude! - [Manu] I was not kidding. - [Mark] Oh my gosh!- [Manu] So this might be 10, 15 eggs on each sides.  Those are antenna. - [Mark] Oh my gosh!- [Manu] So when I said,  when I was sucking it in and it ran away. - Yeah. It senses the pressure variation. - It sense the pressure variation through those.  - That is so crazy. You know what this reminds me of?    Like the first time I saw the stars with a telescope. - [Manu] Yeah?   - Right, so you can see the stars all the time.  - [Manu] Yeah. - And you see even pictures of the stars. But until you actually see it yourself in a telescope,  it's just like something shifts inside you. - Yeah. - And I feel like we're doing the same thing.  - Yeah, yeah. - But just the other way. - No, I think that's such a beautiful analogy. - Okay. So with this 50-cent paper microscope,  you can actually see any malaria in your blood.  We generally think of blood as a red liquid, but it's actually full of particles like red blood cells,  white blood cells, and platelets. And so the problem is in just a couple drops of blood,  you have a billion red blood cells. So it becomes a needle in a haystack to try and find a few that have malaria. So that's where centrifuge comes in.  So you take some blood and you put it in a tubeand the particles will be all mixed up like this.  But when you spin it around really fastfor a couple minutes, the centrifugal force pushes all the heaviest particles to the outside and they displace the less dense particles towards the middle. So when you stop, all the particles are neatly organizedfrom the most dense at the edge,  to the least dense in the center. And since a malaria-infected red blood cell is slightly less dense than a healthy one, you'll always find it inbetween the healthy red blood cells and the clear plasma.  All that's to say, centrifuges are really critical.  So I went to the lab to talk to Manu's colleague, Saad, to see how they applied their frugal science philosophy to this typically really expensive piece of equipment. - These are traditional centrifuges.  These require electricity. And you can see how massive that is. Imagine if you had to caddy this on your back if you're in a research limited settings. - [Mark] Right. - In India, for example, where I grew up.  And so if you want to do this, you can't use something like this, which costs thousands of dollars that requires electricity.  And so while we were out there, we had a full scope.  But you couldn't just take bloodor urine or stool and do it. That became the bottleneck.  And so the design problem statementthat you come up with is, I want something probably less than a dollar,  preferably made out of lightweight materials like paper, so it's easy to carry in your pocket. It should match the speeds of these devices.  You think about different gears and mechanisms and you go into your kitchen and your backyardand start thinking about toys. Toys are a great way. So we start looking at yo-yos, egg beaters,  and others have thought about salad spinners. What we found in this whirligig toy, serendipitously,  is that it's one of the most efficient ways of converting your energy into rotational energy and. . - [Mark] Right. - That was the aha moment.  - [Mark] I see. - [Saad] Using strings as actuation, - [Mark] Right. - In the middle,  rather than mechanical gears, or. . I was just trying this outand as soon as I saw that in 10 seconds,  you kind of know in the back of your mindthat this is something powerful.  And it transitions beyond a toy. That's something that has really important applications.  - [Mark] Right. - In global health, so. . - Let's recreate that moment. - Yes.  - We're gonna take some blood and we're, let's just spin it. - We should take your blood. - [Mark] All right! (upbeat music)  (upbeat music continues)So after spinning only for 10 seconds at 20000 rpm,  you could see my blood was already separating. This is my own blood.  I've never seen my blood at this level before. All right, here we go.  (gentle music) That is crazy.  So each one of those is a blood cell?   - [Saad] Yeah. - [Mark] What I love most about Manu and Saad is their childlike fascination and curiosityabout the world around them.  They're also incredibly observant, looking for ways their engineering talentsmight uniquely help or inspire others.  It's a contagious optimism and it's refreshing.   - The two examples of this are, this is I am awake. Yes! It's too more early morning for me.  - [Mark] That's your alarm?   - That is my alarm. - I love it. - In an extreme case, if it's 9:00 AM, and I'm still not up.  \n","I'm Mark. Hey Vsauce, I'm Jake!And today we are in a replica of the Home Alone house that Jake built with his very own hands. So, as thorough men of science, we have set up a few experiments to test some questionable scenesfrom a few Christmas classics. First, from A ChristmasStory, if you can really shoot your eye out with the Red Rider BB gun?    And then from Elf, what happens when you actually get hit with a snowball at 95 miles an hour?   And finally from Home Alone, what happens if you get a blow torch on your head for 7 seconds?    Not yet, Jake!And these will be the first time we're running these tests, so we truly don't know what's going to happen,  but as firm believers in the scientific method, we're goingto test our hypotheses and then see who is closer to the final result. And the winner gets to keep the leglamp behind us.  What happens to the loser?   The loser has to wear Ralphie's pink bunny suit. Are you ready to do this?    Yes!Let's do it. Let's go.  So in the movie A Christmas Story, all Ralphie wants for Christmas is a Red Rider BB gun, but all theadults in his life keep saying \"No\" because they say \"You'll shoot your eye out, kid. \" What do youthink Jake?    I do think that they're not talking about his eye actually coming out, because you have the optic nerve in there which isabout as thick as your pinky. I think they really mean that the BB is going to penetrate the eye and then it'll go blindwhich, nobody wants.  Nobody wants that!And that seems quite a legitimate concern, right?   And because they say that he'll shoot his owneye out, essentially that means that he shoots, the BB goes out, bounces off something, and hits his own eye.  So to test this out, we have an authentic Red RiderBB gun, and since Jake wouldn't volunteer,  Sorry about that. I had to find some cow eyes that they use for like biology classes and dissections. And so, as a control, we're going to make sure the BB will penetrate the eye first without even bouncing off anything.     Alright, so that went straight through. There was like noissues.  The real question though is the ricochet, right?    Thatis true to the movie. So , on this next one, we're going to have the BBcome straight, it'll hit this steel plate, and then bounce into the eye.  So, will it make it through the eye?    I think, yes. I mean, as you said, it had so much energy, it went all the way into the eye. I think it will hit the plate, ricochet off, and go right into the eye. No problem. I think it's going to hit the plate, it's going to like put a dent in it, it will lose a bunch of energy and it will hit the eye but it won't penetrate it. So, take a moment toguess in the comments below. Who's right?   Me or Jay. Probably me. And, uhh, let's check it out.  Yeah, let's do it.   Totally didn't go through. It is interesting though, you can see the dent in the plate. And I think that was the culprit. Oh totally, and what's also interesting is how muchenergy the eye absorbed. It was, yeah, I don't know, I think it was really great. It's a fair point though, a cow's eye is definitely thicker than a human's eye. So, if that were Ralphie, that's bad news. Like a half of a million people a year lose their eyesight due to like eye injuries. So, eye protection isdefinitely important. But, most importantly, I wonthis challenge.   Ok, so I'm up 1-0, heading into round2. The movie Elf, Buddy is sort of screwing up a bunch of things in the big city, and nobody likes him. But then, his brother gets attacked by a bunch of thugs in Central Park, and he shows off his mad Elf skills. So, I did some investigating, and I found the spot in Central Park where this actually occurred. Then Imeasured the distance, and then I also watched the video back and with how many frames it took and then calculatedthe velocity of the snowball. Turns out, they're going to throw it at 95 miles per hour. Oh my gosh. And yeah, the punks don't even move at all. So the question for round 2, is would you fall backwards if yougot hit by a snowball at 95 miles an hour?    I would say. . . no. I think you might stumble backwards a little bit, but it's not going to knock you flat onthe ground. And I disagree, 95 miles an hour is very fast. And that something hit your chest, you'regoing to move, and stumble back, unlike your hypothesis. Umm. but how are we going to get aa snowball going 95 miles per hour?    That's a great question, and I don't know the answerto it. I originally wanted to use my snowball machine gun.  But, that tops out at like 40 miles an hour.  Yeah that's not good enough. Luckily, as it turns out that if you do the math, that a softball travelling at 65 miles an hour will push you back, just as much as a snowball travellingat 95 miles an hour. And that's because they have the same momentum, which is defined as the weight ofsomething multiplied by how fast it's going. So, since the softball weights a bit more, it needs to be travelling a little bit slower to have the same like push back, ormomentum transferred to you. And thankfully, I have a way to make a softball go 65 miles an hour. Awesome. Ready to suit it up.  Wh. . why?   Oh. . . so you lost the first round. . . so losers always No, no. We don't have to this. That's fine. You lost. [Fanfare] 321Oh.     It looks like the softball pushed Jay back slightly, but not as much as I hypothesized. So that means thatwe're all tied up, heading into the final round.   In the movie Home Alone, Kevin is defending his house from the Wet Bandits with all these amazing homemadebooby traps, which we actually made a video of thaton Jake's channel Vsauce3, so you should go check that out. One of these booby traps is in the kitchen, so when Joe Pesc walked in, the blowtorch goes offwith like 4000 degrees of heat and he just sits there and takes it for 7 seconds. After which, he runs with  hishead on fire for an additional 4 seconds and plunges his head in the snow. And in the end, this is what thedamage looks like. I, you know,  don't think that it is, uhh,  realistic at all. I, uhh, agree that it seems like an underrepresentation of the damage that would havebeen done. So to test this out, the good news is, we actually have a volunteer. Oh, that's lovely.  So, underneath this beanie is a layer of chicken skinand then I drilled into the foam head about 2 inches down and put a bead. And so, thequestion is, do you think it will be hot enough to burn through the beanie, through the skin, and then twoinches down into the head. I think yes, given the duration of time and the amount of heat. It's gonna bepretty severe. It's a bold. . it's a bold claim. I don't think it will actually get all the way down. Alright, well, let's uhh, check it out. Now, it's time.  After filming this video, I was curious, so I talked with a couple of expert surgeons from the Arizona Burn Center. And they told me that if this actually happened to you,  in less than a second, you would have a 3rd degreeburn. They said that the chicken was a good under-representation of the skin covering your skull, andit would take between 10 milliseconds to burn through the hat down to the bone. At that point, you still got 8 seconds left and your skull would protect your brainso it wouldn't be fatal, but it would be so damaged that you probably would need skull reconstruction to replacethe charred portion and that carries with thecomplications that can be fatal. Our moment of truth. . .  let's see, it doesn't look like it's gonna. . .  Ohhh, yes it is. Oh man, ok, so the beanie exposed.  very exposed. Curse you. . . . . So, a disappointing hearty congratulations to Jake for winning. You can keep the amazing light lamp.  We actually made a video in this exact spot on his channel. Aren't you forgetting something?    Like I said, on Jake's channel, we went beyond just blowtorches in Home Alone to to see if some of the other booby traps would actually kill you.  So go check that out, make sure you comment below. Let us know if you did better than Jake or I in your guesses.  \n","I was at a football game recently sitting towards the top like this. And I found myself clapping and I thought 'Wait, does this even matter?    Like can they even hear a clap  from way dow there on the field?   ' if our goal as fans much noise as possible, what is thescientifically proven the best way to do that?    Do you stomp or yell, and should youyell be high-pitched or low pitch?    Does cupping your hands make a difference?   What about one of these?    Or this?    Or one of these?    And should the cheering at the change depending on where your seats are?   I had some guesses, so as a firm believer in the scientific method, I decided totest my hypothesis.  So I've got a controlgroup of three fans- AHAHAH. It's some real nice audio equipment, so they are going to sit in a bunch of different seats allover the stadium and cheer in all thedifferent possible ways and then we're gonna analyze which cheers are theloudest from down here on the field.  But first I needed a baseline to compare our cheering too. And since I attended gradschool at USC, they let me come back to the Coliseum to take some measurements.  And while everyone else was enjoying the game,  I was dutifully collecting audio data.  Mostly.  So now that I've got my baseline for thefull stadium, I think it's time to do our experiment in the empty stadium. You guys ready?   YEEAAHHHH!!!!   So our fans stood in 12 differentlocations throughout the stadium, and in each location they cycle through the same 11 cheers.  And then me my buddy Marcelo, who happens to have a PhD in acoustics, stood at center field andrecorded the data.    Ok so we're finishedand we're currently processing the data.  But before we state the results, I thinkit's important to review the science behind how hearing works. Your eardrums arefancy biological sensors that tell you if anything is pushing on them. It's like if you blow on the back of your hand, you can feel the pressure from theblown air only your eardrums are millions of times more sensitive than that. So these guys represent individual air molecules. And when you hear thatlovely bird chirping, what's actually happening is the birds throat is moving and it pushes the air molecules rightnext to it. Which pushes the molecules next to it and causes a chain reactioncalled a longitudinal wave. And thosecrashes keep happening until they crash into the air molecules in your ear canal,  which then crash into your eardrum, causing it to move just a little.  And depending onthe pattern ofmovement from the repeated crashes, yourbrain is like, \"oh I recognize that as a bird chirp. \" And if the molecules arecrashing it at a high frequency we hear that as a high pitch, and if they'recrashing it is a low frequency, we hear that as a low pitch. And the greaterdistance your eardrum gets pushed in, our brain registers that as a loud sound. Okay, now for the results.  For starters here is the baselines for the loudest soundsI recorded at the actual game.  And then for comparison we took the recorded soundmeasurements from our three fans, and scaled them up. So this is how loud itwould be if all 94 thousand people in the Coliseum were clapping at once. Not surprisingly clapping is in last placeas far as loudness of all the cheers go.  Next up in 8th place are theseThunderStick things. They look sort of obnoxious, but they're not actually that loud. And now in seventh we haveBOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO booing. Which was a bit surprising to meit was so low in the rankings. And as you can see we are now louder than the maxsounds I recorded at the game. And this makes sense, because you never actuallyhave all 94 thousand people cheering atthe same time. Which raises sort of an obvious observation which is that soundis cumulative. So you want to make sure everybody is pitching in. Next up we havea tie for fifth place between the cowbell and the boo-boos. And this wasagain a surprise to me because I remember the constant drone from all of the vuvuzelas from the 2010world cup. But when we were standing at center field, we definitely agreed itwasn't as loud as some of the other cheering. I think they're just really easyfor one person to make a long sustained noise with, and so when you have a couplethousand people with them you get thisconstant drone, but it's not actually that loud of the human ear which bringsup a good point we are measuring loudness here, and not the typical soundpressure or decibel. Decibels aren't actually that great for measuring how ahuman ear perceives sound, because of the constant decibel level we actuallyperceive certain frequencies as louder than others. Loudness accounts for that. So it's a better measurement of what youwould actually here down here on the field.  Additionally, the loudness scale islinear. So if you double the loudness,  that would mean in real life it wouldseem twice as loud. And in third place, we have another tie between screaming atthe top of your lungs without a cone or cupping in your hands, and screaming at thetop of your lungs with cupping yourhands or using a cone. And this seemed counter-intuitive at first, until wenotice the effect of the cone was only slightly more pronounced when you werereally close to the field. So the further from the field you are, the less of adifference it makes. Because as soon as your voice leaves the cone, the pressurewave propagates in all directions. So it's diffused by the time it hits thefield either way. It is encouraging though that from the perspective of theplayers on the field yelling at the top of your lungs is more effective than allthis other stuff. Okay so to set the stage for the first and second loudestcheer, remember that in a sport like American football your goal as a fan isto make so much noise that the players eardrums are moving in and out so muchthat they can't sense the smaller eardrum movements of the snap count. And so they fall start and get a penalty.  This is why the Seahawks recentlyheld the world record for the loudest stadium.  And also have the most false startpenalties by a comfortable margin.  Which means the fans are directly affectingthe outcome of the game.  And so finally, sort of not surprisingly, in first placewe have the air horn. But a very close second place, was one of these weird things.  It's sort of like a kazoo on steroids. It's nearly as loud as an air horn,  but it's small and discreet. And it's powered by your own lungs.  Very few sporting leagues have explicit rulesagainst noise makers, because they're hard to enforce. And so I'm notadvocating this, but I'll simply point out that these things are really cheap, and a student section could pitch in andget a thousand of these things for about a hundred bucks online. *Evil Whistling* So that, cold art science fun on cheering. But it's thorough man of science we knew there was onefinal scenario we needed a test, for all those watching the game at home. OH COME ON!!!!!!!YOU CAN'T RUN THE BALL ON THIRD ?   ?   ?   YOU GOTTA THROW IT!You hear anything Marcelo?    *Shakes Head*Sorry. Wait, you spelled \"subscribing\" wrong. \n","When the super soaker was first invented,  it was a game changer in my neighborhood.  So I wanted to make a version of my own,  only instead of shooting water it would shoot paint.  But my wife wont let me shoot it in the house,  so my awesome brother made me this.  But its not really fun to shoot a paint gun by yourself,  so in my ongoing quest to be the favorite uncle, I decided to invite my nieces and nephews.  You guys ready to do this?    Wait, we're gonna ruin our clothes!Ah, good point.  But before we drastically change the appearance of this room,   let's just take a moment to appreciate the build quality.    Shoutout to David and Ryan from the YouTube channel Eclectical Engineering for helping with the guns.   They're the same guys who help me build the world's largest nerf gun.    You guys ready to do this?    Okay.  Goooo!  Say hello to my little friend!        So, that could've gone better,  but I still have some science to discuss.  Each gun has a pump which gets power from a battery,  and a pump is just a propeller that spins really fast,  and pulls paint from this side and just shoots it out  Nobody cares!   And now it was personal, which left me only one option.  YouTube superstar colinfurze.  You know, this guy.   Colin- Hello Mark, how's it going?   Not great!Colin- The *bark* are you wearing?    Colin- Are you covered in paint?    Yeah, I challenged my nieces and nephews to a paint war and it didn't go very well,  so, I need your help Colin. Colin- So basically, you need old Furze's help here,  Colin- so you can go there and totally destroy your nieces and nephews?     Pretty much. You've come to the right place! Right, let me think, let me think, what do we got, what can we do?      Yup. I've got it, this is what we need to do! Its gonna get proper hot when you do this, alright?    So don't put this thing anywhere near this *laughs* your face could be a mess.   You soak this in gasoline, alright?    When you throw this in the air, okay, make sure you catch And that's it. I think if you do everything I've told ya those kids are not gonna stand a chance mate you're gonna totally destroy them. Now next thing, what are you wearing mate?    Come on!

And as fate would have it, we are actually in- - The backyard. - So I recently made a video where I converted a leaf blower into a snowball machine gun and the first thing he said was- - You should set those on fire.  - So as soon as I got here today, we-(upbeat music)  But flaming snowballs aren't actually why I'm here today.  Show 'em why I'm here today, Kevin.  (glass breaking, splashing)So I actually don't drink, but I've heard of people doing this with beer bottles.  So either Kevin has some superpowers,  or there's some crazy physics going on there that we're gonna try and figure out today.  - So neither of us really knows what causes these bottles to break and there's a lot of conflicting evidence out therebut we have some of our own ideas.  - So as firm believers in the scientific method,  we are going to science our way to the right answer through a bunch of experiments. - I'll drink to that. - Not yet you won't, Kevin. (glass popping, laughing) (glass breaking) (cardboard ripping) (triumph horn blowing)- I've heard that one of the reasons people think it's breaking is because when theyslam their hand down on it, they're forcing a bunch of air in the bottle and that causes the bottom to shoot out.   - So in this experiment, we're testingthe pressure wave theory, where when a person hits it with their hand, they force a bunch of air in that then creates a pressure wavethat pushes out the bottom of the bottle.  So we've put a cap on the top, so there's no way to force air in.  We're using a rubber malletjust to be more consistent for all of the hits.   One. (glass shattering) The bottle broke, even though the cap was on,  and there was no way to force air in, so we are rejecting this theory.  (buzzer horn blowing) - We think carbonation might have something to do with it.  - Okay so to isolate that, we have one beer that's carbonated, one with water,  and then we filled this one with sparkling water.  So if these two don't break and this one breaks,  I think we've isolated that it works better without carbonation. - Yes.  - So this bottle is filled with sparkling water,  so the theory is that it shouldn't break. (popping) And now for the beer, the bottle didn't break,  but that was interesting how much it fizzed up.  So as it turns out, here's why that happens. When you hit the bottle, it moves down really fast,  but the liquid hasn't started moving yet.  That creates an empty gap down here, that's basically a vacuum or really low pressure.   And if the drink is carbonated, the CO2 from the liquid gets sucked into that vacuum and fills it with CO2 gas bubbles.  And since these bubbles are less dense than the drink, they rise up through the liquid and create a chain reaction of more bubbles as they go.  Now finally, we test the water, and just like with the carbonated liquids,  you see this vacuum form on the bottom.  (bumping, glass shattering) Except this time the bottle breaks.  So theory number two is confirmed, non-carbonated liquids work better.  But now we just have to figure out why.  What are they doing differentlyto make the bottle actually break?    - So what I think is breaking the bottleis the momentum of the water going back and filling the vacuum is causing the bottom to break out.  - And I think the break is happening a little bit earlier.  When the vacuum is formed like the air outside is at 14 PSI and so it's pushing in on the vacuum.  So it's before the water rebounds,  it's actually cracking because the difference in pressure.  - Well we'll find out. - [Announcer] Round three. Fight! - So we're gonna add some red dyeand then we're gonna slow the camera down to like 7000 frames per second to see precisely the moment when it happens.  One. (glass shattering, splashing)   So if I'm right, okay, bottle, it should break right there.  - No.  - [Kevin] Yes! - [Mark] (laughing) You punk.  Yeah so you're definitely right.  - Yeah. - It ruptured when the water is coming back right?   - Cracks right after it hits the bottom.  (blow torch screeching) - So Kevin was right. In fact, it turns out that water cavity collapses 10 times faster than it formed,  which creates a force higher than the initial hit on the bottle, which is why it doesn't break right away.  So now that you know the science, if you want to impress your friends with this trick,  here are a couple important tips. Number one, hit the bottle and not your hand.  You want to make as much energy from your strike go into moving the bottle and not just being reacted by your hand.  You can even get the neck of the bottle a little wet and then let it slip a bit when you hit it, just to make sure it's moving.  Number two, like we discovered, use water or something non-carbonated.  Otherwise, the carbonation just fills in that vacuum and cushions the rebound force. Number three, a liquid with a high vapor pressure is good.  If you use a liquid with a high vapor pressure that means the vacuum you need at the bottom of the bottlewill form much easier, so hot water is a lot better than cold water because the vapor pressure's higher.  Nail polish remover also works well for the same reason.  Number four, be safe, this is glass, and glass can cut you if you're not careful where it lands. Number five, don't chicken out.  It hurts way more if you don't follow through.  Plus you look like this. (glass knocking)- Oh, I heard it. Did it hurt?    (Mark groaning) \n","(whimsical music)   - A while back I was eating lunch with some coworkers,  and we were debating about just how far you would sinkif you jumped into a pool of these water balls.  For example, would it go up to your calf or to like your waist or all the way above your head?    Everyone seemed to have a different theory. In fact, I asked about a hundred people,  and you could see how much the guesses varied.  So as a firm believer in the scientific method, I decided to test our hypotheses.  So I'm here today,  in the backyard of the Backyard Scientist.  So for the past six months, we've been stockpiling with these water balls in Kevin's backyard. And today it's finally the moment of truth.  - Yes. (bag tearing) (whimsical music)  (distorted singing)  - I'm alive.  (whimsical music) (distorted singing)   - All right, you ready for this?    - Let's do it. - So take a moment to guess in the comments below of how far you think we'll sink, and then we'll see if you're right.  For the record, I think I will sink to about here. Okay, here we go. Hmm.  (water splashes)(laughs) Oh, my gosh, this feels so crazy.   Just feels like compressed on all sides but it's so smooth and like slippery. So it looks like I was wrong by quite a bit.  And we have to reject the null hypothesis.  (water sloshing) (birds chirping)So, now what?    I decided to call up my nephews.  You guys wanna come swimming at my friend's house?   In my ongoing quest to be the favorite uncle.  Only I might have forgotten to tell themthere'd be no water in the pool.  Also, that Kevin was right there. (Kevin growls) (kids scream and laugh)  You guys ready to go swimming in this?   - Baby, yeah.  - But before we go swimming in 25 million Orbeez,  let's talk about why I was wrong. It has to do with buoyancy. So here's a riddle.  When this ice melts, will the water level go up or down?    As you can see here, it actually doesn't change at all.  Archimedes taught us that you displace your weight in water.  So this baseball weighs about 135 grams,  and when I put it in water, it will sink until it has pushed out 135 grams worth of water,  at which point it's in equilibrium and it floats.  And since the water line is about halfway up the baseballyou know it's about half as dense as water.  And this is why Scooby-Doo quicksand is pure lies.  You sink until you've displaced your weight in quicksand. And since it's about twice as dense as a person,  you bob like a cork about halfway down and it's impossible to sink. So Atreyu. . .  - Artax!- Relax, your horse is gonna float.  So I will keep sinking in Orbeezuntil I have displaced my weight in Orbeez.  And since they're a little more dense than me,  and taking account the packing efficiency of a spheresurrounded by water,  the fact that about 85% of me sank makes sense.  I thought the friction between the ballswould play a bigger role, which is why I guessed halfway, so I was wrong.  But a lot of times that's more fun because that means the result was unexpectedand you learned something. Okay, back to the pool.  Back in there. (whimsical music) (kids laughing and shouting)   (distorted singing)     - [Kid] Yeah.  (kids laughing) (Mark and kids laughing)    (Mark shouts)    (animated mouth burps)(whimsical music)   (distorted singing)       - Guess where my foot is. (Mark and kids laughing) (bell dings) (Mark and kids laughing)(whimsical music)  (Mark and kids shouting)  (water sloshes)- So a huge thanks to Kevin for letting us use his pool.  He actually also made a video. - We did eight crazy experiments with a pool full of water balls. - [Mark] So go check that out 'cause his footage is amazing as always. \n"," - You're up.   (glass shattering)  - People have these Nerf dart wars at work sometimes.  So in an effort to keep people from picking on me I decided to create the world's largest functional Nerf gun.   So I reached out to a couple fellow engineering nerds,   Ryan and David from the YouTube channel,  Eclectical Engineering to see if they were up for the challenge.  So it's one thing to look good,  but let's see how she holds up against the guns of my coworkers.  (upbeat music)            (cups falling)      So here's how it works.  - So the source of the air is this 3000 PSI paintball tank  by pushing the trigger forward,  you let the air into this firing chamber here,   and then when you're ready, you can pull it back to let the air out into the main cylinder and fire a dart.   - So the paintball tank starts at 3000 PSI but the silver chamber is regulated to only 80 PSI per shot.  By doing it this way,  you get about 20 shots out of a single take.  So after you shoot, you just rotate the cylinder over and you can do it five more times.   (upbeat music) The darts exit the gun at about 40 miles per hour    and they're made of pool noodleswith toilet plungers on the end,  which means they can actually stick to things.    So you can use it for a skeet shooting.   (upbeat music)  Or dude perfecting.     We also 3D printed a projectile that was a little more aerodynamic  and we were amazed to see it travel 130 yards.     - [Ryan] Yeah! - [David] Wow.  - So I wanted to seeif this thing actually worked in real life,  and as usual my niece and nephews were picking on me.   So I challenged them to a Nerf dart war.  Only I may have neglected to tell them about my creation.      So a huge thanks to the brains and muscles  of Ryan and Davidfor helping to push this project to completion.   They actually made a video on their channel of everything you need to knowto build one of these for yourself.  - We also made some modifications to the Nerf gun to make it possible to absolutely obliterate watermelons.   So go watch that and subscribe to their channel  because they're kind of new \n","(water splashing) - So I'm here today in Florida filming with Kevin,  more commonly known as The Backyard Scientist. - That's right.  - And today we're gonna take these two live grenades, and we're gonna be dipping 'em in this tub of liquid nitrogen. So go ahead and hand 'em to me.  And then dude, baby alligator.  (grenades bouncing) (water splashes)  (classical uplifting music)  So now we're both about 15 feet away,  except I'm on land with a grenade on land,  and Kevin is in the water with a grenade in the water.  So the question is, which one of us has a better chance of survival?    Take a moment to decide, do you diveon the pool deck or jump in the pool?    We both had very different theories for survival.  So as firm believers in the scientific method,  we decided to test out our hypotheses.  So we devised some experiments.  But before I get to those, I think it's important to understand how a grenade actually works.  So once you pull the pin, as longas you keep this handle pushed down, you're perfectly safe.  But as soon as you let go of the grenade, this handle springs off which releases a spring loaded striker that hits a percussion cap that starts a five second fusethat you can't do anything to stop.  And I never really thought about it until I made this video but the reason you see a waffle pattern in grenades is to create weak points in the shell.  So that's where it's going to break first. And since there are 40 bumps, this grenade is basically an explosion that shoots 40 bullets in all directions.   In warfare, that's what makes them lethal. So the best strategy is to get as far as possible in a few seconds, and then hit the deck with your feet facing towards the grenade.  This presents the smallest possible targetfor a flying grenade chunk to hit.  So 15 feet away.  Mathematically, that puts my chancesof getting hit at less than 1%.  But things are even better for Kevin in the pool.  It's been well documentedthat bullets do not travel far in water at all.  The drag force is so high,  they just disintegrate after a few feet.  So he has a 0% chanceof getting injured by a grenade fragment in the water.  But we are thorough men of science and we wanted more information. So we designed an experiment where we filled three balloons,  half with water and half with air to roughly mimic the human body, which is mostly water, but we have pockets of air in our lungs, intestines,  in our sinuses, in our ears, and then we subjected them to identical explosions,  identical distances apart in both air (shot fires)and water.  (shot fires)As you can see, there isn't much effect on land,  because air is compressible, which helps dissipate energy,  plus the blast wave reflects around objects.  But in water, the story is different.  Water is incompressible, which means not only is the blast wave not dissipated,  but it passes right through your mostly water body.   So the air in these balloons represents the airin your body, like your lungs and your sinuses.  So basically what's happening is the blast wave is pushing in on you,  but the air cavities can't push back with the same force,  since they're filled with compressible air, that means they move a lot really quickly,  which causes permanent damage.  As a control,  you could see this balloon that is filled with just water. It is perfectly fine.  That would be like your arms and legs, which have no air in them, and they are basically incompressiblelike water, and would be fine.  An explosion underwater is sort of like the silver ball things. So this represents the initial energy of the blast,  which then comes down and passes through the incompressible water,  and then comes out without losing any energy at the water surface. But now your squishable lungs are surrounded by incompressible water in the path of the blast wave.  And so when the blast happens, there's a lot of relative motion, which is bad if you like your lungs the way they are right now.  And sadly, our experiment is verified in real life.  So these jerks throw an M80 into the water,  and you can see the devastating effect it has. On land, if a bird were that close to an M80,  it would be startled,  but it would be perfectly fine. So now that you know, think back, which did you choose?    While it's true, there is a small chance you would get unlucky with the grenade chunk if you chose to dive next to me.  If you chose to join Kevin, you will be in that pool for the rest of your life. (upbeat video game music) So huge thanks to the backyard scientist for dying in the name of science.  If you've never seen his stuff, you just have to check it out. Here's a video we just finished filming.  - It's a bunch of which is a non-Newtonian fluid,  and we destroyed it in every way imaginable.  - It's incredible footage. His channel is full of this type of junk.  So check it out, subscribe, and as always, thanks for watching.   \n","(shaking can clicking)(lid popping off)(aerosol spraying) - Recently there was a bombshell announcementin the scientific communitythat there's a bunch of smaller objects in the outer solar systemthat appear to be influenced by the gravityof a massive hidden ninth planet.  So this planet is 10 times more massive than Earth.  It's a hundred billion kilometers away, and it takes 15000 years to orbit the sun once.  So I've seen some pretty impressive videosabout the scale of the solar system,  but they're all still pretty abstract. Because they're either using renderings of the planets or they're using objects and distancesthat have no real world association. So I'm going to attempt to fix that today by representing the planets with justjunk you could find lying around your houseoverlaid onto this football field.  So we'll start by reviewing the scaleof the first eight planets,  and then I will attempt to blow your mindby showing you exactly how far away the newly predicted ninth planet is. (bell dings)♪ I'm so I'm so I'm so ♪ ♪ I'm so I'm so I'm so ♪  (aerosol can clicking and spraying)If you ask how far away Earth orbits the sun,  most people give an answer. . . - I don't know. . . - [Mark] Like this. . . - Right here, I guess. - [Mark] And it's kind of understandable.  About right there?   - OkayStop. - [Mark] Because every picture of the solar system ever looks like these, including my own reporton the solar system from the fourth grade.  (buzzer buzzing)So this is the true scale of the solar system,  starting with our size five soccer ball, sun, which puts Mercury at the 10 yard line as a mere fleck of pepper. (jazzy music) Next is Venus at the 19 yard line. (jazzy music continues)And it's about the head of a pin.  Next up is my favorite planet, Earth.  (jazzy music continues) Orbited by our grain of salt, moon. (jazzy music continues)So if you retain nothing else from this video,  just remember that Earth is the size of a head of a pinand it's at the 26 yard line.  (jazzy music continues) And as the final rocky planetwe have Mars at the 40 yard line, also a fleck of pepper.  And now we start to see bigger gaps. And more than a football field away from our sun,  we have Jupiter which is the scaled size of a grape.  (jazzy music continues)  And after a little bit of exercise, we come to Saturn which is a slightly smaller grape,  and two and a half football fieldsaway from our soccer ball sun.  (jazzy music continues) Next up is the seventh planet, Uranus,  which is the size of a pea.  And its orbit is an average of five football fieldsaway from our sun.  (jazzy music continues)  And finally, we come to Neptune, which is also the size of a pea and orbits around our sun, the size of a soccer ball, nearly eight football fields away.  Now this view should help you appreciate the difficulty in accurately representingboth the size and distance between the planets in a single image. Okay, so before we get to the new ninth planet, let's recap.  (jazzy music continues)So we've got a pepper flake at the 10 yard line for Mercury.  And then a pinhead at the 18 yard line for Venus. And then another pinhead for Earth at the 26 yard line.   And then a pepper flake from Mars at about the 40. And then of course the asteroid belt.  And then we make it to Jupiter, which is a grape at about 135 yards.  Then we cross the street to get to Saturn, which is a grape that orbits at about two and a half football fields around our soccer ball sun. Then we double our distance from the sun to get to the seventh planet which is a peaat five football fields away.  And finally, at nearly eight football fields away from our sun, we have another pea, which is Neptune.  (jazzy music continues)And now we've laid the frameworkfor understanding just how far away Planet Nine is.  Because to reach it, I would need to walk.  And to walk some more. And to keep walking at a brisk pace for five and a half hours before I finally reached the pea that is Planet Nine.   And while of course you can't see it, you'll just have to take my wordthat directly in front of us, 17 and a half miles or 309 football fields away there's a yellow size five soccer ballsitting in an end zone.  In fact, the width of that column you seerepresents the extent of our entire solar system as we know it today. (jazzy music continues) From a different perspective, this would be your view if you parked your spaceship halfway to Planet Nine.  It blows my mind that relatively speaking, our sun, 17 and a half miles away,  would be able to keep this pea in orbit.  But what's just as fascinating to meis when you consider that in our scale model, the sun is represented by a soccer ball,  which anyone could easily fit inside a soccer ball.  And yet our massive star we call the sun, is pretty small when compared to some other stars.  In fact, the largest star we know next to our soccer ball size sunwould be as tall as the Empire State Building.  So I want to close by telling you guysthe craziest thing I learned about space while working at NASA for nine years. Twenty years ago, astronomers did something pretty riskyand decided to point the Hubble telescope at the darkest patch of the night sky for 10 days.  Now, this was risky because time on the Hubble telescopewas extremely limited, and there was a good chance the image would come back completely dark. So they started exposing the shot. And for 10 days, photons entered the telescope and ended their journey of billions of years on Hubble's CCD detector. And at the end of 10 days, this was the resulting image.  With the exception of these single stars, every speck, smudge, and spiral you see in this image is a galaxy with hundreds of billions of stars just like our own Milky Way.  And what truly makes this mind blowingis the portion of the sky represented in this image is the size of Roosevelt's eye on a dimeheld at arms length.  To think about it another way, there are more stars in the universe than there are grains of sand on all the playgrounds, beaches, ocean floors and deserts on our planet.  So next time you're near some sand, take a handful.  And just imagine that one of those tiny grainsis our sun with its orbiting planets.  And then look at the hundreds of thousandsof additional grains of sand in your hand each with their own orbiting planets. And then while holding thatcontemplate how many handfuls of sand exist on our planet.  So in my mind, regardless of how you think this whole universe came to be, there seems to be an infinitesimally small chance that we are alone.

Number one: making and throwing snowballswith your hands is really inefficient.  (Sara McLachlan's \"In the Arms of the Angel\" plays) - And number two: as an uncle, you're always getting unfairly ganged up on.   (\"In the Arms of the Angel\" continues) (snowball thuds)- So in an attempt to address both of these issues I decided to create a snowball machine gun.  (snowballs thump)(laughs maniacally) For starters, I needed to find a power source.  (upbeat music plays) Next, I need to find an awesome brother to help with the planning and fabrication.  And you may remember Brianfrom the video where heBob Vila-ed these LED edge lit tables into existence. (apprehensive music plays)    (music becomes more upbeat) (duct tape squeaks)  - Okay, so here is our first test shot to see if this concept is even gonna work.   So the concept seemed to work.  But since I'm always outnumbered, if I really wanted to level the playing field,  we needed to somehow take this toBuddy the Elf level.  (snowballs land) (kid yelps)(music continues)     (snowballs thump rapidly)  - So as you can see, the concept's pretty simple. You just load up to 15 snowballs in this sort of magazine and then clip it on.  And then use the trigger to control the airflowwhich determines if you want to shoot them hard or soft.  And then this plunger controls the rate of fire.  So you can do a single shot or semi-automatic or just unload them all.  And when you're out of ammo you can just reload a new magazinein less than three seconds.  (music continues)    (snowballs crash and smack)        - It works really well,  and with the pack on your back it's portableso you can use it wherever.  Plus, it makes you look like a freaking Ghost Buster.  (Ghost Buster theme music plays)     - Yeah! (snowball machine whirring) (laughs)- Yeah! (Ghost Buster music resumes)   (snowball machine shoots)  (snowballs thud)     (snowballs smacking rapidly)     - Wait, wait, wait, wait wait.  Why would you wanna shoot me?    - Because. - Just think about it. - It's payback, my friend.  - But I'm such a nice uncle. I don't deserve it.

(laughs)- This is the board game Guess Who.  - You win. - Let's play again. - Can you Guess Who?   - [Narrator] Guess Who. Game cards do not actually talk. - It was created in the early eighties and it was probably my favorite game to playas a kid just because the rules were so simple. Now, we each had different guessing strategies as kids but now that I've taken a bunchof math classes dealing with probabilities, I wonderedif there was a way to just totally dominate every game. So I thought about it a bunch probably more than I should have, but it turnsout there is a super simple guessing strategythat is perfectly legal that theoretically will win you more than 96% of your competitive Guess Who games?    - I tried it out on a bunch of peopleand it absolutely works. So I've been documenting the past two weeks of my lifeand instead of just giving you guys the answer I wanna share in the process of discovery because I feel like mostof the times, that's the coolest part. I'm running about 20 minutes late, but I'm packing right now to take an airplane ride to visit someone I haven't seenin 18 years. His name is Mr. Malloyand he was my high school statistics teacher.  Basically, I think I figured out a killerGuess Who strategy, but I want to pick his brain about it.  As a quick reminderin Guess Who you each draw a card and that's your character. Then for example, you could startby asking does your person wear glasses?    And if they say nothen you would flip down all the people wearing glasses. Then you take turns asking yes or no questionsand the first person to narrow it down to one wins.  I think the biggest strategic question iswhether it's better to ask broad or narrow questions. For example, there's five people with hats.  So a narrow question would be, does your person have a hat?   Now there's about a 20% chance they do. And if you're right you've narrowed it down to five and practically one. On the other handif you ask a more broad question that applies tosay 10 peoplethere's a greater chance the answer will be yes, about 40%.  But because it was more broad, you're still leftwith 10 people to guess from as opposed to only five. So my ride is here, but while I'm traveling try and think of which of the two strategies is better. I'll give you a hint. One is definitely way better than the other.  And the difference is the key to sort ofunlocking the super killer strategy. (bright electronic music)       And I'll just say I've had literally hundreds of teachersover the past 30 years and teachers don't make a difference. Awesome teachers make a difference.  The guy we're about to meet is oneof four or five teachers that have had moreof an effect on shaping me into the person I am todaythan all of the rest of them combined.  (bright electronic music) Each are those awesome teachers have their ownteaching stylebut I think the common thread was I could just tell that they cared about me as a person and their passionabout the subject they were teaching was contagious. You'll see that in a minute with Mr. Malloy.  That's why whenever a teacher asks me tolike Skype with their classroomI always try to find time to make it happen. Mainly is like a fist bumpto that teacher for caring enough to do something more than just reading from a textbook. Cool man. Thanks. I have not seen Mr. Malloyin 18 years and he is in this classroom.  I'm like scared. Here we go.  - My brother. - Brothers don't shake hands. How are you?   The years have been kind to you, old friend.  So there's 24 characters, right?   Okay, so here it is. I mentioned two strategies earlier. One was a more narrow guessing and one was more broad.  I always find it useful in cases like this wherethe answer isn't totally clearto sort of look at the extremes. - Does your person's name rhyme with fralfred?    - No. So Sarah's question is so narrowit only applies to one person.  Is your person African American?   Yes. And thankfully we've evolved, but in Milton Bradley's defense, it was the early eighties and casual racism was still acceptable. You see, with a super narrow guessing strategy. One out of 24 times you actually get it right on the first guess. But equally likely isthat you don't get it right until your final and 24th guess. And since it really has an equal chance of being any one of those numbers, on average it will take 12 guesses to win. Now let's look at the other extremewith the really broad question.  So the broadest question would applyto exactly half of the characters. So no matterif the answer is yes or no, you knock down half.  So starting with 24then it goes to 12, then to six, and then to threeand then to either two or one, and then your final guess.  So in this case you would always win in five or six moves. So any other combination of narrow versus broad questions including the 10 and five person questionsI mentioned before would just fall somewhere in between. And this gives you a huge advantage because the game is intentionally designed to ask narrow questions. So prepare to have your mind blown, but every single attribute and Guess Who applies to exactly five people. So five people have glasses, five have mustaches five people have red hairfive have hats, blue eyes, five are womenfive are bald, blonde hair, black hair, white hair, exactly.  Five people even have big noses and rosy cheeks. So given that every attribute applies to only five people how can you possibly ask a question that appliesto exactly half of them?   Well, there's several different ways to do itbut one idea is to ask a question like does your person have white hair or red hair or glasses?   Now this is perfectly legal since the rules state you just have to ask a yes or no question. Then on your next turn, you just pick some combination of attributes that applies to half the remaining people. Another idea would bedoes your person's name start with a letters A through L?   - No, that sounds right.  - Okay, good. I have his approval. (laughing)Okay. And now for the hard partI want to know what is the true probabilityof me winning with this strategy, right?    I wanna know when I gointo battle against my six year old nephew, How confident can I be that I'm gonna win?   - Right?    - Can you do that?    - Yeah. - Okay. Statistics!Let's talk about it. - Well, here's an example of a random event happening.  There's 256 little BBs in here, okay?   And when they drop through the hopperthey always make this normal curve.  It's a random process, but you do knowthat the group will always look like this. It's fascinating. - And what's also fascinating is that anytime you have a bell curve like this in real life, it always breaksdown to the percentage you see here for each standarddeviation away from the average in the middle.  So for example, every time you flip that card over about 38%of the BBs will always fall into the chute in the middle. - So even though your strategy is better than your opponents, sometimes he'll win. So knowing the from the mean and the standard deviation and the normal curve calculationswe can calculate how often he'll win in three moves, okay?   And how often he'll win in seven moves, say, okay. And then if you multiply those probabilities together using the multiplication ruleyou'll actually get a little square here and that sayswhat's the probability of that game happening?    And you can fill in this whole gridand know all the probabilitiesof a certain game occurring.  And if you add these up, we have 99%of all the outcomes of the games you lose 14% of the time.  - And you got thatby just saying two plus two plus two plus two plus six. - It's that easy, yep. And you win 63% of the time.  - This is super cool because these percentagesfor a bell curve match up with exactly what our BBsshowed us earlier in real life, right?    So just to make sure I got this, for our hypotheticalsituation here, there is a 38% chance my opponent will guess their person in six moves. Yep. Now I'm a little better. So there's a 38% chance that I will guess my person in five moves. Yes. So the chance of having that game happen where I winin five guesses versus his six guesses is 15% right?    And that's because 38% times 38% equals 15. - Yep. You just multiply, it's just like a rectangular area. - It's just like old times.  It's like we multiplied all the time in your class. - Just like back in the day, all that multiplying. - Now, one of the things I rememberfrom your class is that I can't just like play three games and assume that that's goingto be statistically valid, right?   - Yes.  - How many games of Guess Who do I need to playto be confident that I have the right distribution?   - You would have to play 625 games.  - That's a big number. (laughing)- That's a lot of Guess Who. - That is a lot of Guess Who.  So I have 625 games to go, but at the end of thatmy goal is to find the true bell curve for the standard strategyand the true bell curve for my tricky strategy, right?   And then at that point, I can populate this chart and then I can add up the pink numbers, right?   So that means if I sit downand play my five year old nephew in Guess WhoI'll be like there's a 90% chance I win I'm gonna destroy the undergroundGuess Who gambling market in Vegas with one YouTube video.  (bright electronic music)  So it was gonna take a while to finish 625 games.  So I called up my super smart buddy Chadwho you might recognizefrom when we built the annoying coworker countdown NES hack.  - Oh gosh. - And with Chad's big brain and a computer program he wrote emulating the standard guessing strategy. After a thousand games, we discover the typicalGuess Who player will take about seven guesses with the standard deviation of about two. So when you plug that into Mr. Malloy's chart, we find that the improved guessing strategy will win 80%of the time. Now, at the beginning of this videoI promised you would win 96% of your Guess Who games. And the key to get there is just to play first one to five wins. Guess Who actually calls this championship mode?   And they even provide pegsfor you to keep track of the first one to five.  The reason this increases your chances so much isbecause of what's called the law of large numbers. Basically, the more games you play, there's a regressionto the mean or a convergence to the predicted probability.  So this dash line is your predicted winning percentagebut to win overall you just need to win more games than you lose. So you want to be above the dried spaghetti line at 50%. Now this spot here is just pizza grease and it has no meaning. So you might get unlucky and lose the first gamebut then you win the second game. Now this frozen chicken nugget will represent the running average, and right now it's right in the middle. But let's say you get unlucky and lose the third gameif the match was over now you would lose since the nugget is below the spaghetti. But the law of large number statesthat over time the chicken nugget will migratetowards the dashed line and then just stay there.  So after a while you can see that even if your opponent goeson a hot streak, the nugget doesn't move muchand you can pretty much guarantee victory since there's no way we'll dip back down below the spaghetti. This is exactly why Vegas casinos have no windows or clocks.  They have a small statistical advantage. So the longer you stay therethe more they are guaranteed to come out ahead. And it's also why if LeBron James ever challenges you to a game of one-on-onedo not play best two out of three, play one game. First point wins if possible.  But you know what I like a lot morethan children's board games?   Knowledge. \n","- So my favorite class in high school was physics. It opened my eyes to the fact that we can understandand predict so much of the everyday world around us using math and equations. (upbeat music) So today I wanna revisit the classic high schoolphysics egg drop competition, where you have to build some sort of contraption around an egg to make sure it doesn't crackwhen it hits the ground. Originally I wanted to do a bunch of research and testing to find the single best wayto win the competition every time. But what I found out was that each competitionsort of has different rules.  In some, you're not allowed to use popcorn or parachutes, and in others, you win if your contraption is the smallest, or the lightest, or both.  So I'm gonna show you five super easy optionsand then we'll talk about why each one works. Let's go crack some eggs.  (upbeat music) (upbeat music continues) Okay, so let's start with the popcorn ball. The basic principle is that you put your eggin the middle of a box that contains some kind of cushioning materials, such as bubble wrap, or packing peanuts, or popcorn. Personally, I think this one is the most boring,  but it works. And that's why every shipping company ever ships this way. (upbeat music) I'm using a ball herebecause it's more weight-efficient than a box, where you have unnecessary cushioning in the corners.  Plus the stretchiness of the ballwill help absorb some of the energy.  (bag exploding)(upbeat music) The moment of truth. And we have an intact egg. Now, before I show you the other four ideas,  let's talk about the science behind landingwith an uncracked egg. So at the start of your drop, your egg is up high and it's stationary.  So it has potential energy, which is the energy associated with height. So these red blocks represent the potential energy.  And the higher I go, the more blocks of energy I start with.  And then as the egg falls, that potential energy is converted to kinetic energy, which is the energy of speed.  So you start up highand every single block is over here as potential energy. But as you start to fall, and fall faster and faster,  every single block comes over here as kinetic energy, or speed.  And now your egg is about to impact the groundand has all this energy in the form of speedthat's got to go somewhere.  Now this broom represents the standing energythat holds an eggshell together and makes it hard. So the way to think about thisis when your egg hits the ground,  if you introduce more energy than the binding energyof the molecule holding the hard eggshell together at any point, you're going to break at that point. So the question then becomes,  what can we do to keep our blocks below the broom?   Because, simply put, below the broom, your egg is safe.  Anything above the broom and your egg is busted. Well, there's two things we can do. The first is that we can make this pile of green blocks not as tall. This is why no matter what your contraption isto protect the egg, if your rules allow it, you should make a parachute.  The bigger, the better. And it does not have to be fancy. This is like old school army guy style.  Just cut up a trash bag, little bit of string, little bit of tape. And just looking at this, you can see the difference a parachute could make.  So the second thing you could dois not to remove any green blocks by reducing your speed, but to spread them out. So if we say left to right is our time axis,  the more we could stretch out this impact event, the more we can lower that high energy spike.  And this is a cool way to think aboutany two objects impacting. The longer the duration of the impact,  the more you can spread out that forceso stuff doesn't break. So for example, this is the point of car airbags.  Instead of your head hitting the steering wheeland stopping near instantaneously, it stretches out the impact force over time so you don't get a quick spikethat exceeds the broom line for your skull. This is exactly why long jumpers prefer to land in sand and not on asphalt, and why parkour runners will always roll after a big jump.  It's all about diffusing the forceover a longer period of time. So what does that mean for our egg contraptions?    It's really just something to keep in mind, because it can make it more intuitive, for example, to see why putting your eggin the middle of a jar of peanut butter,  which is a popular, and not a very good idea, isn't as good as putting your egg in the middle of a popcorn ball. Okay, back to the bridge. (upbeat music) So a lot of people like to build contraptions outta straws.  And in some competitions, that's all you have to work with. How you configure your strawsdepends a little bit on how stiff they are.  The good folks at Wendy's have fairly stiff straws, which means I didn't have to use quite as many.  So my idea was to take six, like three-inch long straws, and build a regular triangular pyramid,  and then put the egg in the middle. And then I took two of the Wendy's strawsand joined them together to sort of make a mega straw.  And I used this wide tape to help prevent it from buckling.  And then I made six of those mega strawsand simply taped one to each edge of the pyramid.  (upbeat music) So the main point here is thatthere are no straws pointing directly at the egg.  When it impacts the ground, the force goes up the stiffest path through the straw. I saw a ton of examples online where the straw was actually pointed at the egg, which would create a puncture load. In our case, we have this pyramid, so all the loads pass next to the egg,  so you don't get that primary impact. Three, two, one.  (upbeat music) So you'll notice, we've got a couple of broken pieces, but that's okay because it took energy to make those breaks and that served to protect the shell of the egg from receiving that energy. So, success. (upbeat music) Okay, so our egg finally broke.  But it took about 20 tries. And you can see there's a lot of busted straws here.  All in all, it was pretty resilient. Yah!(upbeat music) So this one is a throwback to my NASA roots.  In 2004, the MER rovers landed on Mars using giant airbags.  And even though Mars has one-third the gravity of Earth, I figured it would still work.  I started by cushioning the egg in four little balloonsthat I barely filled up. And then I blew up bigger balloons and then just tied it all togetherwith some string and tape. And then if there's any gaps in coverage,  you can just tape a balloon directly to the stringyou just tied around. (upbeat music) In addition to the balloons extending the impact time, this design benefits from a large cross-sectional area relative to its weight. So in a sense, it becomes its own parachute.  Of course, if your rules allow it, you should still throw an additional parachuteon it anyways.  - [Announcer] Touchdown confirmed. We're safe on Mars. (group cheering) (upbeat music) - [Mark] In 2012, we landed another rover on Mars called Curiosity.  But this one was too big to use airbags, so we had to have a power descent, pretty much like a jet pack.  So I wanted to pay tribute to Curiositysince I got to work on it for seven years. And at first, I was thinking like model rockets,  but without gyroscopes and control algorithms, things could get pretty unsafe pretty quickly. So I thought of this idea where I used balloons that could deflateand then they would provide upward thrust before landing.  But it, no. (bell dinging)(upbeat music)  (upbeat music continues)And as ridiculous as this might seem, it's actually not a violation for most rules because you're not touching it once you've released it. The fact is most competitions are using rules that were written before you could go on Amazonand buy a toy drone for less than 50 bucks. (drone whirring)  Intact egg. (upbeat music) I've saved this one for lastsince I've never seen anyone do it, and it's probably my favorite in terms of its simplicity.  (upbeat music) You wanna buy a few more balloons than you needand then just pop 'em, until you get to the point where you're just under neutrally buoyant. And you can see at the bottom, I've just got this little protector of the egg.  You don't have to get fancy, but I use those little animal balloonsand it seems to work pretty good. This one weighs in at a couple ounces.  So it is a strong optionif your competition favors lighter contraptions. (upbeat music)  (egg cracking)So which one is the best?   Again, it sort of depends on the rules of your competition.  In some cases, being smallest gets you the most points. So I'm thinking, \"Airwolf\" all the way.  If being lightweight is the most important, then go with the helium up house method. And if your egg just needs to survive, then you can pick any one of these.  But the most important part is to have fun and experimentand learn something, and then to dominate your competition.  Yeah, you guys are good. No, it's all right. It's all right.  And now you're on YouTube! (dramatic music)Thanks for watching.  If you learned something or if you didn't learn something, or if you're a mammal, then you should subscribe.  Is your blood warm?    You got a four-chambered heart?   Welcome aboard.  (upbeat music)\n","- So I'm making this videoto show you how to protect yourselffrom a brand new and really easy way for a bad guy to steal your ATM pin code with an iPhone.  Even if you're shielding the keypad so he can't see you put it in.  And to show how hard it's even to detect that it happened,  I'm gonna go into this store and steal somebody else's code.  So watch closely to see if you can tell the moment that I actually do it.  (screen pops)So she just swiped her ATM card,  and she's inputting the pin here,   which is the last thing you dobefore you finish your transaction and then I step up to make my purchase.  (upbeat music)  So that was it.  If you missed it, let me play that last part over again.  You'll see as I walk up,  my phone just briefly hovers over the keypad.   So let me explain what just happened. (screen pops) So what I've got here is a device from a company called FLIR that just came out onto the marketand it clips onto the back of an iPhone and it displays infrared,  which basically allows you to see the temperature of things.  Here's where it gets interesting.  30 seconds ago I was sitting on this couch.  You probably can't tell where, but how about now?    Anytime two objects interact,  they will tend toward thermal equilibrium.  So they basically try and meetin the middle temperature-wise.  And since I am warmer than the couch,  heat flows from my bodyto the spot on the couch where I'm sitting.  So this leaves behind a thermal signature,  because it'll take a little time for that spot on the couch to cool back down and reach thermal equilibrium once again with the air. Likewise, if I set my warm hand on the cold wall,  afterwards my hand is slightly colder,  the wall is slightly warmer where I touched it.  And as you probably guess by now,  your fingers leave a thermal signature when you type your PIN code (buttons beeping)into a debit card machine like this.  And as you can see, in this case,  the pin code was 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. (screen pops)- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. - Yes. - That's amazing.  I've got the same combination on my luggage. (chuckling) (screen pops) - And it gets worse, because since the heat signature fades with time,  the bad guy can figure out the order in which the keys were pressed, because the hottest button is likely the one that was pressed last,  and the dimmest button is likely the onethat was pressed first.  So after doing some digging around on this, I was able to find a paper that was published about this method by some researchers at UCSD several years ago.  According to their data, they could guess the right pin code numbers 80% of the time if the image was taken right after.  And if the image was taken a full one minute later,  they still had a 50-50 chance of getting the numbers right.  Scary thing is back then, infrared cameras cost $10000  and it would be really hardto discreetly sneak something of this size into the store.  Now, an infrared camera looks like an iPhone case.  They're a couple hundred bucks and you can get them at any Apple store.  (screen pops) However, there are two pieces of good news here.  The first is that this won't work on all keypads.  For example, metal keypads reflect IR like a mirror.  Plus they're highly thermally conductive,  which dissipates the heat quickly,  which doesn't allow for a thermal signatureto even be left behind.  However, I still found plenty examples of rubber and plastic buttons in my area that definitely left behind a thermal signature.  Not to mention the other applications beyond PIN codes,  such as door entry systems. The second, and this is the real point of this video,  is that it is really easy to defend against this by simply resting your fingers on other buttons as you type in your code.  As you can see here, this simple precaution makes a meaningless thermal signature.  So spread the word, because it doesn't take any extra effort or time,  and it makes this potential threat a complete non-issue.  (screen pops) Oh, and finally,  if you are part of the 11% of the population whose PIN code actually is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,  consider this sage advice.  - [President Skroob] Change the combination on my luggage.  - [Colonel Sandurz] Yes, sir. (door hisses)- [Dark Helmet] Aww.  (screen crashes)(upbeat music)          \n","This is a pinewood derby car it comes in a kitThen you build it and put it together and then it uses gravity to go down a trackSo over a hundred million of these cars have been built and raised by kids over the past 60 years which means over 100 million Dads have spent a lot of time at the workbench, and then subsequently pretended their kid helped in some Meaningful wayBut don't feel bad for the boys because someday they'll grow up to be dads And then they'll get a chance to work on a car of their very own. Now this is a much faster pinewood derby car, but waitThis was my entry. I was disqualified because apparently using jet propulsion goes against the \"spirit\" of the competition  This is a much faster legal car, but what is it about this one that makes it so much faster than this one Really is it the wheels is it the weight?   Placement is it the axles and of the design features that influence speed which one of those is the most important for example do?    Aerodynamics really play a role so todayWe're gonna use cold hard science to figure out how you can maximize your chance of taking home the trophyWith the least amount of effort there are a lot of opinions on how you build a fast car and spoiler alert Some of those popular ones are completely false and at the end of the video to prove science isn't back trueI'll show you a car built in 45 minutes based on what I learned and then show you how to do Competition so let's start with the fundamentals the pinewood derby is all aboutConservation of energy the amount of energy you start the race with it's the same amount of energy you form the race with it's just A different kind so each of these blocks represents a unit of energy so at the beginning of the race it's allPotential energy which is the energy associated with height?    So when you start the height of your center of masses on the trackThe more of it you have and then at the end of the race in a perfect world all that potential energy Has been converted to kinetic energy block 4 block the kineticenergy is the energy of speed so you were really high on the track and as you came down all that height was converted into Speed and you notice I said in a perfect world because in realityWe lose some of that kinetic energy to friction its dissipated through heatBut you will notice that these two piles of friction and Kinetic energy still add up to the original potential energy We started with Energy is conservedSo if you can reduce friction that means you're going to have more kinetic energy and that is the keyThis pile is the key to winning the race because it has the speed term in there and whoever has the higher Pile of blocks here wins the race every time so for the rest of this video. We're gonna discussWhat truly matters and amazing your kinetic energy or your speed or this pipe?    How do you make this pile as big as possible with the least amount of effort okay?   So before we go any furtherI want to introduce you to someone I met while doing the research for building the perfect powered derby car. My name is Scott Act All aerospace about Ten years ago my sonAnd I my wife's car out of the garage and we converted into the pinewood derby research facility for almost a year we conducted experimentsAnd use the laws of physics to determine exactly what takes make a winning pinewood derby race car what I love about Dr.  Acton is that instead of just making blind statements like99% of the information you find out there he used theScientific method does all the possible parameters that go into building a pinewood derby car and then he documented the results, okay?    So what did he learn after year of testing so here's a list of seven of the parameters he tested and how many car lengths?    You would win by if you're able to perfect that specific parameter assuming everything else was the sameSo the first thing you should notice is by far the biggest contributor to increasing the speed your car is Maxing out the weight of your car at five ounces and then putting it in the right location towards the rear of the carso that alone contributes to 36% of the speedier car and you would be a car that had the worst possible mass placement location at the very front of theCar by almost five car lengths if everything else was identical between your two cars So why is this well if you put all your weight toward the back of the car like this when you're sitting on the track?   Before you even start your center of mass is higher up Than if the weight was concentrated at the front of the car that means you automatically startWith more potential energy and since energy is conservative. We added two blocks here We have to add two blocks on the other side of the equation which means you get more kinetic energy and againThat's the energy of speed which means you're going faster when you get to the bottom of the ramp So another way to look at it is to say both cars will roll down the ramp at this same speedUntil they get to the bottom now at this point the blue car is done accelerating But the red car has all the mass at the back and is still falling and will continue to be pushed forward sort of giving it a turbo boost when it gets to the platform so now the question remains, how far back shouldThe mass be placed now the mass is too Far backYou're Gonna Pop a wheelieand be totally unstable and clearly that's bad so doctor act and ran trials on 40 cars and Concentrated the mass in different locations on the car and this chart is an example of kind of data that he produced so somewhere around 0.9 to 1.5 inches in front of the rear axle gives you the best timesSo if you want to narrow it down even more than that it kind of depends on the shape your car the doctor actually went into more details into this in a videohe made it's like 2 hours long it details all theResults of his tests and even shows you like some tips and footage of how to actually fabricate the car So we want a lot more detail than I'm giving here. I highly recommend you check it outI put a link to it in the description of this videoSo let's quickly run through the remaining list of the critical parameters light weighting wheels to give you a two car lengths We'd everything else being equal if your race rules allow you need to take as much weight off this wheel as possible especially the outerEdge or just buy some that are done for you And I put a link of the video description of where you can get some now to explain why thisMatters let's go back to our blocks. I didn't tell you the full story when it comes to kinetic Energy so remember this is the energy of motion and when you cross the finish like technically you have two types of motions your caris translating but the wheels are also rotating about the axis now that gives us rotational kinetic energy now this green pile of Translating Kinetic energy is still the most important because that represents your cars speed and this orange pile With spinning wheels actually takes away from thatSo if we can minimize the moment of inertia on each of the wheels by making as light as possibleAround the Edge that means more of our initial potential energy will go into making our car go fastAnd not just spinning up the wheels with a lot of energy so when you high center at the end the wheels are just spinningForever that's energy. We could have used to make our car Go fast, so the most streamlined pinewood derby car is going to be to normal block of wood by about 1.4Car lengths and everything else is equal now going back to our blocks you're not very aerodynamic It's basically just a form of friction so essentially the more streamlined your profile is the fewer air moleculesYou basically have to push out of the way So you don't have to kill yourself here making some attempt to make the car a little bit more streamlined in the standard block isGonna be worth it using polished axles will be normal axles by about one point three car lengths everything else being equal I was actually surprised this wasn't a greater tribute to overall speed, but drak around 35 trials of differentSmoothness on the axles, and this is what the data show interestingly grooved axles are a complete waste of time and money if you look at the formula for Friction it really just depends on theTwo materials of the services rub it together and sort of the weight at that surface so even if you reduce your surface area by a factor of two the overall weight acting at those services is the same so Nothing changes, so lifting one wheel on your carSo your cars only riding on three wheels will be a four wheeled car by about one point one car lengths Everything else being equal and most people say oh, it's one less wheel that's 1/4 the frictionBut for the reasons we talked about that's not true because each wheel just has more weight on and the real reason this actually helps Goes back to our rotational kinetic energy now remember the green pile is what you want to maximize and if you have one less wheelto get spinning as you start going down the ramp that means that energy gets to go to our kinetic energy of Translation which means the Faster velocity at the finish lineFinally adding graphic to your wheels and axles will make your car win by about point nine car lengths Everything else be equal against the car that has no ground now there are several really expensive graphite solutions out there but all the extra side pocket basically saidGraphite graphite that's Clever marketing our independent tests show that there's really no appreciable difference between one versus anotherSo there's a number of other parameters, Dr.  Act and discusses in his videos, but those six are the ones that will have the biggest impactRelative at the time you spend on your car so in order to prove that science is true and to show that those six steps Are really the best use of your time on the day of our big race here?   I decided to completely build a car from scratch in about 45 minutesand then take it at theCompetition and see how it did so the first thing I did would just make a single cut in this block of wood so remember Aerodynamics are important, but there's no need to totally kill yourself on it. Just a simple reduced shape is good Okay, so the next step is polishing the axleso here's a before and afterBasically you just want to take your axle put it in a drill press or even a hand drill and duct tape down the trigger And then you just take different levels of sandpaper and just different water and put it on the nailYeah, you go all the way from you know 600 mm. Grit the last step should be some sort of polishing compound I put a link to another Youtube video that covers this in a lot more detail in the video descriptionAnd then I went ahead and mark the 12 o'clock position on the nail head and this is why?    So in doing research to talking with a bunch of experts. I actually found two things that dr. . Acton didn't testThese are the concept of rail riding and the concept of bending your axles So your wheels are canting so let's start with bending the axle so to bend the axlesI use this bending tool from dirty workSo right there you just bend the nail then you take it out of the clamp, and then you have an axle That's been at exactly 2. 5. DegreesSo if you don't want to go to the hassle, you could actually buy pre bent and pre polished axles onlineI put a link to where you can get them in the video description So bent axles are important for two reasons the first is that it reduces frictionAnd this is because as you roll down the track to weigh the axles are bent the wheels want to migrate outwards And that's good because it reduces friction in the sense that part that's rubbing isThe wheel and the nail head which has a much lower coefficient of friction than if the wheels just bouncing around Rubbing against the wooden body of the car the second reason. They're really important is it makes alignment a hundred times easier?   We'll get to that in a minute and now I just put the wheels on the car And this is a good time to apply the graphite just get it everywhereYou really can't over apply it and now because I'm going our car to only write on three wheelsIDeepen one side of the pre-cut axle groove in the front and now because it's deeper that front left wheel won't touch the ground so Now you see. I am just pushing these axles in my handI mean there are tools that sell for like ninety dollars that help you align them and people talk about drilling the hole is just Perpendicular, but it really doesn't matter if you're using cannon axlesYou just kind of put them in the pre-made slots And then afterwards I just use a screwdriver just to make sure the nails were actually flush in each of those slotsAnd it doesn't matter because with the cannon axles you can align it later So this is where it leaves us at the front and left wheels rates it up off the ground you can see the back twoWheels or can it outwards but you notice the front wheel is actually candid the opposite Direction?    This is the other thing drak that didn't look at but it was called the rail righty technique now rail riding means youIntentionally steer your car into the rail that runs down the track and guides your car now That sounds crazy like it's totally going to increase your friction and a lot of experts recommend spendingHours and hours on a line of your car, so it runs perfectly straight so the problem with that is no track has a perfect surface, so even thePerfectly aligned car is going to bounce around on the track So these bounces are incredibly detrimental because with each impact you're taking some of your kinetic energyAnd it's being converted to friction and heatAgain Kinetic Energy in this pile are the key to winning the race so watch this slow-mo video of this rail rider car I've built this is another car that actually ran pretty straight on a normal flat surfaceSo the key to the rail rider car is it turns toward the center rail, but just barely enough So it maintains contact with the rail. So here's that you set up the rail rider, so get yourself a nice flat boardThat's about 4 to 6 feet long and your car should be r about 1 inch toward the side that has the wheel raised The length of that board so in this case it beer too much and this is the genius of the ben taxes Because to change direction. We don't have to shim or glue. All you do is twist the NailheadIt doesn't take muchAnd then once I did that it was just about rightSo once again if you want more information on the rail riding alignment process I put a link in the video description That goes into a lot more depthAnd then you also want to check the rear wheels just to make sure they are migrating outwards You should see a little daylight between the wheel and the car body and then again if they're not all you have to do isget some pliers and twist the head of the axle andSo the final step in just getting our center of mass in the right spot So I measure an inch in front of the rear axle, and then just to prove that ghetto is perfectly fine hereI'm using duct tape and then you just kind of balance it on that line that We drew you probably never get the balance exactBut you just do enough to convince yourself that it's more or less in the right spot nowThere are actually some pinewood derby racing leagues held on the monthly basis for adults across the country so I asked a few the experts Who run them what do all the winning cars have in common and the reason I took the two additional concept of the rail rider?   And the canted wheel seriously is because they told me all of the cars that not only win But are in turn have three things in common. They all right on three wheels and not fourThey all rail ride and they all have canted wheels So at the race my buddyMason won first place with an undefeated record in a field of 20 cars he even beat my 40 mile an hour rocket car Although that probably had more to do the fact that my dumb friend. Troy sabotage my firing mechanism Oh, so the rematch I would straight for the jugular  Now Mason told me they spent at least 12 hours building this park focusing on the huge list of things that'sSupposable you have to do everything for and I have the fastest car now after the race I asked to borrow his card once everybodyLeft I did a couple test runs his undefeated 12-hour car against my 45-minute car, and this is the result  in fact my 45-minute car Beardloss of this car of my buddies And he's like an expert racer in fact this exact car has won many races even the district level okay, so in summary I recommend maximizing the way to your car at five ounces andPlacing it in the correct spot on the car about an inch in front of the rear axles. Have a reasonably aerodynamic car and have it right on three wheelsLightweight those wheels if your race rules allow it and then get the been polished axleSo you could reduce your friction make it a lot easier to align and you can implement the rail riding technique And then just run your rail rider alignment test and make sure you use plenty of graphiteSo make sure you check out the links in the description for more detail on some of the steps I didn't cover folie plus if you want to save yourself a little timeI have some links there that show you where you get some of this stuff pre-made like the bent polished axlesSo this video is way longer than I typically like to make my videos, but hopefully you found it helpful So above all hope you guys have fun and he uses an opportunity to get excited about science and physics and then use that to Turn around and just dominate every other car in the race  \n","[('i', 27024), ('the', 26167), ('you', 26050), ('it', 17836), ('to', 17749), ('a', 17390), ('we', 13120), ('this', 12335), ('and', 12317), ('that', 11809), ('is', 10664), ('of', 9836), ('in', 8609), ('do', 8140), ('so', 7554), ('oh', 6743), ('all', 6656), ('right', 6184), ('my', 6105), ('on', 5753), ('for', 5732), ('just', 5656), ('what', 5589), ('go', 5298), ('na', 5256), ('have', 5215), ('like', 4999), ('here', 4860), ('he', 4808), ('yeah', 4482), ('gon', 4377), ('one', 4342), ('was', 4245), ('are', 4153), ('no', 4119), ('get', 4078), ('there', 4076), ('me', 3934), ('they', 3748), ('got', 3742), ('your', 3737), ('can', 3654), ('out', 3488), ('now', 3483), ('not', 3473), ('if', 3389), ('be', 3326), ('up', 3234), ('with', 3212), ('but', 3159), ('let', 2884), ('at', 2846), ('know', 2810), ('guys', 2784), ('how', 2743), ('did', 2612), ('going', 2500), ('see', 2428), ('good', 2360), ('okay', 2217), ('think', 2200), ('chris', 2001), ('about', 1867), ('as', 1854), ('really', 1818), ('two', 1747), ('chandler', 1736), ('music', 1713), ('man', 1707), ('want', 1693), ('him', 1680), ('time', 1672), ('hey', 1621), ('our', 1618), ('more', 1580), ('then', 1553), ('some', 1553), ('back', 1552), ('jimmy', 1500), ('these', 1492), ('would', 1475), ('an', 1468), ('car', 1456), ('them', 1441), ('make', 1409), ('look', 1403), ('way', 1385), ('over', 1380), ('actually', 1380), ('or', 1362), ('god', 1361), ('come', 1348), ('from', 1315), ('take', 1298), ('people', 1290), ('give', 1274), ('us', 1261), ('need', 1245), ('yes', 1214), ('dude', 1213)]\n"]}],"source":["nltk.download('punkt')\n","# Assuming your dataset is stored in a variable named `dataset`\n","transcript_data = data[\"items\"]\n","\n","word_counts = Counter()\n","\n","for vid in transcript_data:\n","    # Combine all transcripts into a single string\n","    all_transcripts = \" \".join(interval['transcript'] for interval in vid)\n","    print(all_transcripts)\n","    # Tokenize the combined transcripts\n","    tokens = word_tokenize(all_transcripts)\n","\n","    # Convert all tokens to lowercase to ensure case-insensitive counting\n","    tokens_lower = [token.lower() for token in tokens if token.isalpha()]  # isalpha() removes punctuation\n","\n","    # Count the occurrences of each word\n","    word_counts += Counter(tokens_lower)\n","\n","# Find the top 100 most common words\n","top_words = word_counts.most_common(100)\n","\n","print(top_words)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"25f82abda6c541368ccd05ac545643a6","deepnote_cell_type":"text-cell-p","formattedRanges":[]},"source":["The large no. of stopwords show that we ought to remove the stopwords to ensure better and more accurate analysis."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"cell_id":"ced10c2e128c484ebe8edc64500cb1d3","deepnote_cell_type":"code","deepnote_to_be_reexecuted":false,"execution_millis":23213,"execution_start":1710911199815,"source_hash":null},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["wait long . subject gratuitous amounts broken glass , 'm gon na start little broken glass .

Smells gross . knew reviewing Berkeley footagethat Zinka extremely interested squirrels . Taxidermied squirrel . fat , guys , record .

Ah ! ( hard rock music ) Yeah ! Yes ! lost clothes , also lost lot skin cells hopefully . Good luck , Shay . since Zinka would definitely wantingto follow scent roadin direction wind , picked random spot sneak directionon trail leading straight heartof redwood forest . stream running alongside trail , took opportunity test ideathat dogs ca n't track 're stepping waterthat 's sweeping scent away .

're gon na take leap faith , land rock , realize 's stable foot wiggle predicted , 're gon na fall river sometimes . leads second three pieces adviceto maximize chance positively impacting world making video cut , frame failures . Ah , tell 's juicy part'cause music 's back . illustrate mean , asked 50000 YouTube followers subscribed channelto play simple computer programming puzzle made . n't knowis served two slightly different versionsof puzzle . one , failed puzzle , n't lose starting 200 points , prompted try . Whereas , n't succeed , also prompted try , said taking away five starting 200 points . difference . even though value real world , one ever see completely fake , meaningless internet points , n't lose points attempted solve puzzle 2 . 5 times moreand saw success 16 % time . 50000 people took test , results super statistically significant . Basically , n't frame losingin negative light stuck longer , saw success , learned . think great example thisin real life video games . `` Super Mario Brothers '' first came , friends became obsessedwith making castleand rescuing Princess Peach Evil Bowser . 'd get school ask , `` Dude , level make ? pass game ? `` never asked detailson different ways might 've died . `` Call Duty . `` comes video games like , one ever picks controller first time , falls pit right away , thinks , `` 'm ashamed . failure . 'm never . gon na break Luigi ? murdered brother . `` ( audience laughs ) really happens think , `` Okay , got ta remember 's pit . Next time 'm gon na come bit speed . `` focus obsession beating game , dumb might lookif get hit sliding green shell . direct result attitude , learning focused failures , got really good learned tonin short amount time . personal work life , 've dealt share sliding green shells . still feel like every video make month 's moment seems everythingthat go wrong gone wrong . failures gut wrenching , sting real bad . sting like missing one key Mario long jump , right end level 8-1.And right , really quickly turns , okay , learn ? know , try differently next time ? concept life gamification positive attitude never give , imply fightagainst true desire quit . feel like frame challengeor learning process way , actually want . feels natural ignore failure try . way toddler want keep tryingto stand . way want keep playing `` Super Mario Bros. `` way half peoplewho attempted coding puzzle desire stickwith 2 . 5 times longer . framing failures made itso wanted keep trying learning . 's exactly meaningful high fivesof adolescence said , `` Dude , finally beat Bowser last night . `` Probably goes without saying , girls n't talk much older . ( audience laughs ) case 're like , `` Yeah , real life would much betterif top five challenges disappear , `` would ? 'd like point thatif `` Super Mario Bros. `` jumping one pit , rescued Princess Peach , one would play . 's risk reward ? 's challenge ? 's ultimate feeling satisfaction . degree 're getting today means much precisely struggleand setbacks 've endure . want cross river life , 're gon na get wet . 're gon na backtrack , 's bug , 's feature . Frame failures slips like video game , learn faster , make successful jumps along waythat much sweeter . right . 've got good news , 're crossing river alone : third final bit adviceis foster relationships . Nice . sad truth getting olderis life gets busier busier , gets harder harder make really close friendslike school . n't great evolvedto social , cooperative creatures , right ? Like , 50000 years ago , conditions much harsher . inclined cooperatewith fellow humans also much likelyto succeed pass cooperation genes . 've inherited brains designedfor social interaction , hardwired cooperate people . look , n't blame youif want cast aside advice guy makes living trying outwit squirrels , would n't recommend thatto 6 million years evolutionary programming . today 's society , 's really convenient isolate . attend board meeting kitchen table . order food shower . bank toilet . could even look new apartmentwithout leaving apartment . 's easier stay anonymous big cities versus small tribes ancestors , everyone knew , means 've got actively workat fostering meaningful relationships . know could harderfor others , 's life hack 've found really helps . Confirmation bias brain ignores evidencethat n't support beliefs , cherry picks evidence . generally , people hear term , think 's broken , unscientific wayfor brains approach world . true , could sort judo flip advantage . trick positively apply confirmation bias relationships . assume good intentionson part friends family , tell 're lucky , brain naturally work find evidence support . 's brains work . tell yourselfthat fellow humans inherently good , brain find examples everywhere , reinforce outlook . opposite , unfortunately , also true . Basically , whether think worldand everyone hurt help , 're right . Studies shown best predictor divorceis couple assumes bad intentions partner 's actions , marry Kanye . ( audience applauds ) get headthat partner selfish inconsiderate , willfully refusing take garbage , creates negative feedback loop confirmation bias , seeking find evidence spouse jerk , even good-faith efforts made . hack works justfor spouses , friends , family , even total strangers might infuriate . look , agree . 're wrong . n't forget , George Carlin pointed , anyone 's driving slower idiot , anyone driving faster maniac . Fostering relationship closes listof three bits advice may impact greatest . Due challenging upbringing , mom barely graduated high school , took mom instilling valuesin children really seriously . , 's single biggest influenceon life far . passed away decade ago ALS , six months ever released first YouTube video . love idea ripplesfrom influence still feltas strongly ever havethrough work try today . anything 've said today resonated , mind , 's direct result commitmentto third piece advice . leverage confirmation biasto enhance relationshipsas cooperate cross river . Train brain assume good intentions . try remember , someone cuts freeway , maybe 're get . Maybe diarrhea . ( audience laughs ) piece advice number four , engage occasional playful anarchy . Mark , told us gon na give usthree pieces advice . Boom , 's fourth , 'cause ? 'm playing music commencement speech , ? ending speechwith pump-up music objectively better ? like graduation robes hats objectively silly . n't take fourth piece advice right nowand engage playful anarchy ? Anybody toss hat air . see every graduation . dared make actually fly . ( majestic music ) bet Buzz Aldrin never tried . know , timeout . actually great opportunityto review everything talked . ( audience laughs ) first point , embrace naive optimismthat hat actually get airborne . , second point , goes haywire , accidentally blow E53 , reframe failure opportunityto renovate old sketchy building . Maybe time 'll even add windows . third point , get sued faculty , foster relationship havewith defense lawyers , ( audience laughs ) settling MITover damages bring us closer together . , turning hats , 've done part filmed banger introto upcoming collab 30 years , means 's left part : go change world better .

First , pull back bedsheetsand check corners mattress , know look . Second , n't set suitcase bed floor . Instead set luggage rack . reason feel like needto extra cautious , bathtub . third , n't put clothes hotel drawersor leave lying around . Whatever 're wearing stay luggageor hanging hangers . right , super carefulwhen staying hotel travel , got back bought couch Craigslist smoking deal , got bedbugs home .

First defense , put bed bag . buy mattress box spring encasementsoff Amazon , zip around bed , basically seal bedbugs currently living inside . remember live 300 days . ca n't take year . trap current bedbugs , also remove mattress hems clever hidingspots love use . Number two , clothes dryer , wash dryer clothes sheets least week , often n't hurt . Importantly , want wash hot waterand dry highest heat setting 's impossible survive . Number three , simplify de-clutter . Simplify room take away hiding spotsby putting clutter plastic bags totes . n't interested clean clothes , dirty clothes smell nice . 's good also store plastic bag tote 're ready wash . Also , move bed away wall , way get bedis climbing legs . 's three steps defense . , offense . Number one , vacuum . Make sure vacuum bedroom floorand bed area week . sure empty anything 've collected bag , trash . number two , 've got diatomaceous earth , , recall , superstar tests . definitely apply around bed . 's especially useful penetrating cracksand crevices close bed , including around behind power outlets . key applying light dusting , like . leave clumps , actually backfireand effective , 'cause 'll navigate around . finally number three , 've got steam . simple clothes steamer like job . think 's great years moneyspent creating synthetic pesticides , two effective methods killing bedbugsare crushed rocks really hot water , far two simple natural . Use steamer around bed week , find something want treat , ca n't steam put dryer , put bag put freezerfor three days also kill . Professor Wong said , small infestation noticed , using three defensive offensive stepswill totally take care problemwithout needing spend money exterminator . However , 've got lot bedbugsand 've long time , getting professional help probably good idea . entire house heating option takes eight hours , 's sure fire way totally eradicateevery bedbug , along eggs . cost $ 4000 , depending size place .

'Cause look guts modified see-through piano , something inventedby Italian dude 300 years ago , see 's pretty complicated . fact , zoom isolate single key , 's happening every time push downon white part . 're thinking like engineer , know best design always onethat gets job done simple way possible . first saw , offense Bartolomeo Cristofori , inventor piano , seemed overly complicated . mean , first piano ever played ( bright piano music ) pretty dang simple . Like , ca n't class one leverwhere push , 's fulcrum middle , hits string ? Well , turns 's two problemswith right bat . first hammer remains contact string hold key . means string n't free wiggle vibrate , sound created . Like , guitar , ( string vibrating ) sounds great touch strings . ca n't vibrate , n't hear anything . fact , see ( metal clacks ) 's exactly problem toy piano . second problem upright piano , strings must vertical fit . 's easy enough fixif shift add extra hinge point . However , 'll notice 're still damping string . see , ( string vibrates ) piano continue making sound , even 'm holding key . ? Well , Bartolomeo got real cleverand added little extra hardware . press key , jack flings hammer forwardso hits string , jack gets foot caught , moves wayso hammer move back dampen string . Fun fact : people think pianos considered string instruments , hammer-like actionis 're actually classified percussion . ( bright piano music ) Okay . press key , continue make noise . wait , let finger go , sound stop . something damping string . look current build , could see let key go , 's nothing stop stringfrom continuing vibrate make sound . solve , Bartolomeo added extra pivot point hardware . see damper rests stringand keeps quiet press key . hammer strikes . 's free vibrateand create noise way upto moment key released . finally , wan na play note really quickly repeatedly like , ( simple piano music ) need hammer close string way back like . adding backstop , keeps hammer close hitin case need quickly hit . . Apologies fellow engineer , Bartolomeo . turns 's complicated needs beand . 's also sort simplistically beautifulthat functionality one input , ( string vibrates ) every time press single key . , Chopstix special case , 's see-through , play . true pianos play aroundfor 100 years , 's important difference . old player piano works scrolling paper sheet like , encounters hole , passes air , plays key . keys played full force , timing n't precise . Whereas Chopstix modern versionthat uses solenoid actuate key . place solenoids right , rod extends , 's different someone actually pressing key . see lined along . solenoids , get timing downto fractions second , 127 different levels increasing force press piano key , means make perfect recreationsof human player .

Next , tried even harder roomto prove n't luck , , finished 46 minutes evidence seemed compelling . proof , niece nephewand bunch friendsfirst try room without telling tips . made halfway throughat end full hour . walked 10 tips together went back new roomwith equal level difficulty . time finished 55 minutes clues . 're probably thinkingwhat qualifies giving tipsabout escape roomswhen 've ever done three ? answer absolutely nothing . 're actually tips . track architect designerof Red Bull Escape Room World Championships . 's college professor . name Scott Nicholson . problem live Californiaand 's way Brantford , Ontario , Canada . 's typically 12 hour tripthrough magic YouTube , knew could make therein six second travel montage . ( upbeat music plays )  - [ Mark Rober ] Okay , Canadaat Begin Lab Laurier Universitywith Scott Nicholson . Scott , heck ? place ? - Well , place make games . focus actually making games change world . lot games make herehave sort learning outcome . goal help get people learn stuffin playful way . - [ Mark Rober ] Professor Nicholson Ihung together day generously spilledout information large brain . even put challengesand puzzles . 10 tips came awaywith hanging . first tip think simple . Think generally . Keep reminding average person able complete room one hour . well-designed room , wo n't need extra knowledgebesides find room . People tend overanalyzeand go rabbit hole . example one room , found travel log robber , went Washington Mexico Cityup Toronto . first trying look interstates would travel onand maybe code , 're likemaybe unscramble names countries . realized path forms Vwhich happened first letterin combination lock trying open . ca n't find simple answer puzzle , chances 's necessary informationhas n't revealed yet . move come back later . second tip deals searching . first thing dowhen enter roomis everyone split upand start looking clues items . Professor Nicholson actually put methrough searching bootcampto point typical placesthat things hidden . - [ Dr. Nicholson ] go . Always look tables , always look rugs . write codes back rugs . - [ Mark Rober ] spots might hollowed books pockets clothingor behind door room . super common first time mistakeis look places n't , example , wo n't find clue disassembling ceiling light power outlet . Another common searching mistake see cluesin things n't . example , bottom chair lettersand numbers factory , 're obviously part room designbecause n't fit theme . Going back tip one , clues key itemsshould fairly obvious well-designed room . escape rooms , 'll get sensefor n't real clue . Tip three , organize stuff . search room , put clues items one location . found three similar cupslike numbers bottom , group together . , bigger picture begins emerge 's easier tell 're missing . n't let people walk around itemrandomly hand others n't know . ask start , almost rooms policywhere use one clueor one lock one time . 've used clue item , put discard pileand sure leave key lock opened . helps avoid unnecessary wasting time . team member working puzzlethey n't realize already solved used . tip four , team starting make sense roomlaser focus stopping moving forward . going feel overwhelmed beginning . Even record breaking times , halfway thoughtthere way 're gon na even come close finishing . solve one thingand everything else starts falling place . help , work backwards thing stopping , identify inputs needs . example , room , see 's lock hereand looks like key right need kind hanger fish . 's cabineton wall probably contains hanger lock needs three letters two numbers . focuson clues yield three numbers two lettersand wo n't vulnerable red herrings . - red herring something 's put roomthat bearing upon game . something simple , oh , got ta really important . - Yeah . - Clearly . - Yeah . - roomseven red herring puzzlesthat lead nothing . player , 's incredibly frustrating . 've done studies . players hate red herringsbecause 're waste time . half designers hate red herringsand put rooms . half like , yeahthey 're okay room . - working backwards immediate inputs needed , 'll avoid wasting time red herring clues . Tip five team roles . According Dr. Nicholson , poor communication number one reasonwhy teams fail . list eight different rolesthat team members assigned link , one seemed criticalin experience project manager . helps alleviate issue poor communication . - project manager n't get overly involvedin puzzles . Instead , project manager personpeople report say , Hey , 's four digit combination lock . - see . - project manager call . Okay , everyone 're looking four digits . Someone comes says , Hey , 's , 's five letter word lock . Okay , 're looking five letters . 's poster looks funny . Okay , everyone take look poster . 're searching something , might find poster . project manager keep ideaof active tasks , needs done . - Yeah . - 's working , keep game flow going . - see . - try keep themselvesout getting buried puzzles . - makes sense . - keepa scan 's happening . - first five tips focused general team strategies , last half puzzle solving strategies . familiar common locksand inputs , 're working back 's stopping know lock requires three letters , everyone could focus finding three letters . standard key lock obvious . combination lock 're lookingfor four numbers specific order . 's combination lockof letters numbers , five total . classic dial lock need threenumbers total , start spinning clockwise . open like . 've got directional lockwhich little trickier anywherefrom two 30 inputs . Squeeze threetimes wipe clean need try . Finally , one lock boxes , againtricky 've got anywhere two 10 inputs , 's good know use number onceand order n't matter . one , six , zero , five works , five , zero , six , one . critical tip locks 're pretty sureyou right code , 's opening someone else try move . given pressure game . tip save us three separate occasions . finally , skip trying figureout last digit know rest justby trial error , 10 options . According Professor Nicholson 's research , half escape roomswill kind codethat need decipher . - [ Dr. Nicholson ] 's basic codes 've seen , knowing look like useful . , 're gon na expected memorizethe encoding scheme , tells , ah , 're looking encoding scheme . - [ Mark Rober ] upper left , anytime see dots dashesyou thinking Morse code . Usually 's written , sometimes lights flashing long short even long short sounds . upper right called pigpen cipherand 's often disguised hieroglyphics . key look something like . see could decode message . anytime see dots group six like , know 're looking braille key . letter braille combination six dots . finally , Dr. Nicholson said experience , time might get decoder keyis set numbers ranging one 26.In case , match corresponding letter alphabet . becomes H E L L . Tip eight written clues . Dr. Nicholson created challenge meof four common styles hiding cluesin written text . Pause video see find four separate hidden messages . first obvious bold letters . Look watch face . second words missing letter . remove telephone keypad , find secret . Next , one stumped us little one rooms , look capitalized words . secret code six , seven , three , four . finally , look first wordof new line left side , secret phrase goodnight sweet prince . key looking somethingthat stands normal pattern would expect see . leads us second last tip . Look patterns . Dr. Nicholson gave one last challenge . - [ Dr. Nicholson ] lock might indicate need enter thingsin order red , green , blue . - [ Mark Rober ] one pretty straightforward , think code ? fact , pause videoif want decipher three codeson board . top four , three , six , based number sides . one bottom , need count different colored circlesand enter order . three , six , four , one . finally middle see digitalnumerical notation used lot escape rooms . code five , four , seven . Apologies colorblind peeps therebecause probably could n't solve last one , exactly type reasonwhy cycle people trying solve tough puzzles . fresh perspective takesin many cases . helped us multiple times . final tip , guide friend . Listen closelywhen 're giving instructions beginning . lot times give subtle hints issues trip lot people . also ask high level questionslike one lock , one use policy . even n't want hints , ask prompt 're waybehind people would certain point . end day , 're fun . 's better take hintand feel excitement escaping room , stuck frustrating clue 40 minutes . finally , fewer people almost always better . Statistically , 'll higher success ratebecause n't deal issues poor communication amongst 10 people . 's also finite numberof fun things room . fewer people , fun stuff everyone gets . quote Dr. Nicholson 's Twitter , policy number people escape roomis number people tent , matter package says , 'll better time half capacity . go . know best strategies dominate next escape room .

're willing move greater distanceyou 're able reduce amountof force proportional amount . ca n't lift 500 pounds worth car one timebut could lift 10 pounds 50 times . mechanical advantage ratioof output force input force . case 's 50.That means hand travel 50 times furtherthan lifting car one shotbut weight 50 times less totally worth . principle mechanical advantage everywhere . Let 's take look examples . four pulleys , means pull rope four times dumbbell goes . exchange , feels four times lighter . mechanical advantage four . ramp , look ratio length height . mechanical advantage therefore 2 . 2 . means travel little furtherbut brick feel 2 . 2 times lighter pulling ramp versus pulling brick straight . sure enough , measure scalethis exactly see . think ita screw ramp wrapped around nail . look traveledaround thread divide space inbetween threads get mechanical advantage nine . know , really wan na multiply force use ratchet wrench . distance hand travelsfor one full rotation 300 times longer distancethe screw moves vertically one thread . total mechanical advantage 300.It 's like really long short ramp . scale reads six poundsthe actual clamping force would 300 times nearly ton . wheels axles , 's story . Since wheel diameter twice one isas could probably guess weight weighs twice much . 're balanced mechanical advantage two .

Alright , 's enough foundation nowlet 's go Texas meet upwith buddy Al build race cars . ( upbeat music ) - [ Man ] U. S. . ( upbeat music ) - [ Mark ] mousetrap carworld record holderbut also kind started whole thing Texas high school physics teacher year . since dream job one day switchfrom working engineer private sector togo teach high school physics somewhere , made show cool demos . - came idea back 1991 since time literally built thousands thousandsof mousetrap cars . 've seen every possible engineering designyou could ever come . - 's lots different variationsfor rules mousetrap car race . Let 's talk abouthow build best long distance car first . testing , started three identical cars . difference length leather arm . one short , one medium , one long . 've calculated mechanical advantages see written . given know mechanical advantagewhat think happen ? - Ready ? - Yep . might 've guessed , short lever arm car takes strong early lead . makes sense largest mechanicaladvantage , therefore highest force wheelsand ground meet . downside 's short-lived burst medium long lever arm cars pass 's quickly usedup energy . end , far traveled longest leverarm car going slowest , making wayto 30 feet . brings first principle long distance car , win want smallest possible forceover longest possible distance . words , smallest fractionfor mechanical advantage possible . want car barely creeping forward wasteas little energy possible . think total energy springas amount water cup , cup represents amount energy 's passedonto car move forward . quickly dump energy , ton spills splashes , due lossesfrom extra heat generated even drag force windwhich proportional velocity squared . slowlyand controlled , much energygoes actually moving car forward . next thing tested adding graphite axleson three cars erase . made huge difference went far , longest lever armcar slowest . shows importance dealing friction . 's definitely biggest enemy cars friction comes two spots . rolling frictionbetween wheels groundand biggie axles car body . put lubricating graphite powder . take testing step furtherwe took long lever arm carand added ball bearings place graphite set new record us 50 feet . one hour make carand wan na good showingyou use long lever arm like conjunction CD wheels give mechanical advantageof one 360and use ball bearings axlesor apply graphite 're gon na pretty well . Next , figured long lever arms make travel slowerand therefore , super long lever arm . made herewhich worse even short lever arm car . problem n't coast well make really bigwhich means 's heavy , means friction . know already intuitivelybecause 's harder push heavy object table light objectbecause 's friction resisting . principle three make lightweight . love example though shows need balance principles . take oneof far another principle creepin start penalizing . 's optimization problem 's makes mousetrap racers great project . 's also testing important . tweaking testing different thingslike Al critical honing sweet spot specific design . Next , tried big wheel designwhich popular approach . strategy wheel 56 times larger wheel axle . combine lever armyou get built-in mechanical advantage one 840and 's equivalent lever arm 's two half feet long , without needing big heavy carthat seems like good deal suchit best car yet made way . downside isthat takes energy get big wheel like rotating . 's called rotational inertia . 's demo built showcase principle . two wheels identicalexcept one steel weights placedat outer edge wheel versus near axle . means higher rotational inertia . spin identicallythe one right starts spinning fasterand reach higher max speedbut one left coast longer . bigger heavy wheels , 're basically using temporary storage energyand give back coasting phase . problem anytime transfer energy lose . Going back cups , little splashesout time pour , matter slowly . instead pouring spring energy big cup eventually getting back coasting phaseit 's better reasonable size wheelsand one slow pour directly final cup making car move . Additionally , big wheels like hard steer . principle four reduce rotational inertia . also see peopledo wheels sometimes . 's effort keep wheels largein diameter get built-in mechanical advantagebut make wait less reduce energy given rotational inertia . final test ran Al 's world record carwhich traveled astounding 600 feet . set record , crazy things like using jewelers bearings axlesbut real secret pulley middle . look ratiosand calculate mechanical advantagefrom lever , pulley , wheels 're looking one 4 , 608.It 's equivalent 16 foot lever arm back wheel four half feet diameter , without downsideof extra weight wasted rotational inertia , thing barely crawls along . 's hard even see spring lever arm moving back wheel spins . 's really hard beat design like . 'll quickly go speed car principlesince principles apply . biggest difference time want toaccess energy springin short burst right beginningbecause finish line 15 feet away . n't make sense really smallmechanical advantage like pulley car . want much closer direct forceof spring , would mechanical advantage one . Problem , wheels would slip . basically want incrementally increaseyour mechanical advantage making rear axle thicker thicker tape rear wheels start slip . Slipping bad coursebecause 's wasted energy wheel spinningwithout actually moving car forward . 's helpful zoom use slow-moon phone see wheels slipping . means good tractionon rear wheels importantbecause means higher forces start slip . squishy foam wheels work greatand like distance car , reducing frictionby using bearings graphite definitely help . making lightweightbecause Newton 's second law teaches usthat heavier things harder accelerate . like throw baseball furtherthan heavy bowling ball smaller diameter wheels helpby keeping mechanical advantage closer onebut n't time give energyto big wheels get back coasting . want spring energy go directlyinto making car go forward .

Well , 's two things . first make pile green blocks tall . matter contraption isto protect egg , rules allow , make parachute . bigger , better . fancy . like old school army guy style . cut trash bag , little bit string , little bit tape . looking , see difference parachute could make . second thing could dois remove green blocks reducing speed , spread . say left right time axis , could stretch impact event , lower high energy spike . cool way think aboutany two objects impacting . longer duration impact , spread forceso stuff n't break . example , point car airbags . Instead head hitting steering wheeland stopping near instantaneously , stretches impact force time n't get quick spikethat exceeds broom line skull . exactly long jumpers prefer land sand asphalt , parkour runners always roll big jump . 's diffusing forceover longer period time . mean egg contraptions ? 's really something keep mind , make intuitive , example , see putting eggin middle jar peanut butter , popular , good idea , n't good putting egg middle popcorn ball . Okay , back bridge . ( upbeat music ) lot people like build contraptions outta straws . competitions , 's work . configure strawsdepends little bit stiff . good folks Wendy 's fairly stiff straws , means n't use quite many . idea take six , like three-inch long straws , build regular triangular pyramid , put egg middle . took two Wendy 's strawsand joined together sort make mega straw . used wide tape help prevent buckling . made six mega strawsand simply taped one edge pyramid . ( upbeat music ) main point thatthere straws pointing directly egg . impacts ground , force goes stiffest path straw . saw ton examples online straw actually pointed egg , would create puncture load . case , pyramid , loads pass next egg , n't get primary impact . Three , two , one . ( upbeat music ) 'll notice , 've got couple broken pieces , 's okay took energy make breaks served protect shell egg receiving energy . , success . ( upbeat music ) Okay , egg finally broke . took 20 tries . see 's lot busted straws . , pretty resilient . Yah ! ( upbeat music ) one throwback NASA roots . 2004 , MER rovers landed Mars using giant airbags . even though Mars one-third gravity Earth , figured would still work . started cushioning egg four little balloonsthat barely filled . blew bigger balloons tied togetherwith string tape . 's gaps coverage , tape balloon directly stringyou tied around . ( upbeat music ) addition balloons extending impact time , design benefits large cross-sectional area relative weight . sense , becomes parachute . course , rules allow , still throw additional parachuteon anyways . - [ Announcer ] Touchdown confirmed . 're safe Mars . ( group cheering ) ( upbeat music ) - [ Mark ] 2012 , landed another rover Mars called Curiosity . one big use airbags , power descent , pretty much like jet pack . wanted pay tribute Curiositysince got work seven years . first , thinking like model rockets , without gyroscopes control algorithms , things could get pretty unsafe pretty quickly . thought idea used balloons could deflateand would provide upward thrust landing . , . ( bell dinging ) ( upbeat music )  ( upbeat music continues ) ridiculous might seem , 's actually violation rules 're touching 've released . fact competitions using rules written could go Amazonand buy toy drone less 50 bucks . ( drone whirring )  Intact egg . ( upbeat music ) 've saved one lastsince 've never seen anyone , 's probably favorite terms simplicity . ( upbeat music ) wan na buy balloons needand pop 'em , get point 're neutrally buoyant . see bottom , 've got little protector egg . n't get fancy , use little animal balloonsand seems work pretty good . one weighs couple ounces . strong optionif competition favors lighter contraptions . ( upbeat music )  ( egg cracking ) one best ? , sort depends rules competition . cases , smallest gets points . 'm thinking , `` Airwolf '' way . lightweight important , go helium house method . egg needs survive , pick one . important part fun experimentand learn something , dominate competition . Yeah , guys good . , 's right . 's right . 're YouTube ! ( dramatic music ) Thanks watching . learned something n't learn something , 're mammal , subscribe . blood warm ? got four-chambered heart ?
